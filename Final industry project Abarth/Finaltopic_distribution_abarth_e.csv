Neither Zoe nor Tesla even make the list. The 1 & 2 cars from 2016 and not a single person reviewed their car? 
 
For one I know I completed the review this year, and I know a couple of other folk that reviewed before closing date. And yet Zoe isn't on the list at all. 
 
I'm not screaming fix, but its really odd the 2 highest placed cars are nowhere, and that both scored higher last year than this years winner (a Skoda, in a magazine famously heavily sponsored by VAG and SHELL). 
 
So can we have a show of hands for who voted for 2017."

I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today. 
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range. 
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc.  
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no  problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk. 
 
Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly. 
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV. 
 
And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster) 
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that. 
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that! 
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise. 
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one.  
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?%  
 
As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!"

And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat.  
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell! 
 
Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode."

The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks… 
 
Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car."

Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.

The problem is I love cheap sports cars, having owned Nissan 350z's and Toyota Celicas in the past, but after following climate change science I've decided to reduce my carbon emissions as much as possible and there doesn't seem to be very much on the market to fill the gap. I have my zero emission Leaf which is brilliant, but it's obviously not sporty. And if you do drive it briskly you end up at a charge point sooner than expected  . I'd love to buy a Tesla (roadster or model S), but they are outside of my price range especially as a second car. i3 Rex is a possibility, but it's not really designed as a sports car and a bit on the expensive side for what I'm thinking of.  
 
It's a shame toyota didn't put a tuned Prius 1.8L hybrid system in a new Celica or Mazda/Honda couldn't do something with a range extender In their small sports cars. I've always fancied an American muscle car such as the Mustang they are bringing over here this year, but I'm guessing it's not going to be less than 50g/km!  
 
I'm looking forward to when zero and low emission vehicles are available across all the different vehicle types, but the car industry seems to be a little on the conservative side in this arena at the moment. Maybe I just want my cake and eat it "

Will I be mad to not test drive before ordering? I went to my local dealer today and sat in the car and am 100% certain that I’ll be opting for a 4+ because the financial maths works out very well for me, as well as the BIK saving over ICE I will be paid an extra £150 per month for electing to take a lower band vehicle than my entitlement. 
 
I didn’t test drive my last 2 company ICE cars, having never driven those makes previously, both have been absolutely fine and no regrets. If it makes a difference I don’t do m(any) work miles and so the car will be 95% personal local mileage. 
 
I’ve read that driving an EV is MUCH different to ICE so do I need a test drive to learn the basics of driving an EV or can I ‘teach myself’ when it’s delivered? 
 
Sorry if this is a silly question but test driving a car is something that I’ve never done before!"

However, it may be worthwhile looking up who made up that plate, and report THEM to the DVLA, because by law in the UK, they have to check the V5c registration certificate to determine fuel type and it should be 'electric' or 'hydrogen fuel-cell' to get that green flash. If they're not checking the V5c, including the purchaser's identity, before issuing the plate, then they could be aiding and abetting a host of other crimes.

I thought the stated reason for the green flash was only to raise awareness of BEVs. It would be useless for any official purpose as it would be so easy to fake. A bit of green insulating tape could be added and removed in seconds. 
 
i confess I never look for them nor notice them. I recognise the cars rather than a small green flash on the number plate. For our Soul, we just let the dealer decide. 
 
I don’t see why EVs should be allowed in bus lanes, be given parking privileges or be exempt congestion charges, they take up the same space. ULEZ exemption is fair enough but they will go when almost all vehicles are low emission. The ”encouragement” to get an EV will be driven by the ban on new ICE but, from what I have read on the forum, there are not enough EVs to meet demand anyway."

Before I do something drastic after only 6 months of ownership then I thought I'd better sense check to see if some of the things that bug me are might actually be easily fixed. 
 
Background - my first EV but I'd wanted one for years, liked it on the short test drive of standard but ended up buying an S Edition 186 miles away because I wanted the part leather and a different colour than white.   
I didn't actually expect to like the Zoe, just drove it more to explore all limited options and it surprised me in a good way at the time. 
 
My main gripes that bother me are; 
The ride - I didn't notice on the test drive, but the ride/handling is a major gripe. Feels too soft or missing an anti-roll bar at the front and waaaay too stiff at the rear, to the point where going over bumps even at low speed causes me back pain... and I haven't had back issues for 30 years.  
 
The car really wants to rear-end another car - the brakes seem somewhat unpredictable compared to normal braking systems. If I brake or slow gently (guessing just on regen) then when I reach about 8mph the car decides it wants to surge forward, just when you're coming close to a car behind and you then have to re-apply considerably more brake. This is fairly consistent but at the same time variable in severity depending on pedal pressure. Braking harder (not actually hard, I'm still driving it normally) lessens this issue but isn't the way an EV should ideally be driven? 
 
Brakes again - coming to a stop or initially moving away, the brakes groan a bit as the pads go on or off fully. iirc my ex-wife's two older scenics were similar and it was basically down to the caliper carriers flexing as they weren't as stiff as they could be. It's not a functional problem but it sounds like I'm driving an old banger. 
 
More minor irritations; 
The radio - sometimes it just stops receiving a signal or at least stops making a sound, from a couple of minutes up to half an hour I think the longest one was. Intermittent. Can happen on a 5 minute journey to my girlfriend's or an hour into a journey or be fine for a week. It makes other sounds still, sat nav etc and can play from bluetooth still. 
 
Door lock buttons stop working - intermittent, I normally lock and unlock via the buttons as my keys are in my pocket. Sometimes this just doesn't work. Either locking or unlocking. 
 
Public charging speed unreliable - less of an issue now I have a home charger but I bought the car just before lockdown and which delayed my house move so I ended up having to use the public charging infrastructure. So I charged and shopped as best I could. But I could start the car charging at 22kW, go to the shop, come out and it had dropped down to 3kW or anywhere in between. Other times it'll start low on a 22/43kW charger but if you disconnect and reconnect to the same charger it'll charge at full rate. It just seems inconsistent and it didn't matter what make of charger I plugged it into. This often left me sitting in my car waiting to get enough charge because it had dropped to a crawl after I'd left it. 
 
Tailgate rattle? - sounds like the tailgate or lock is rattling, knocking when driving around. Can't replicate it when stationary so it could be something else. 
 
Super soft paint - seems softer than any other I've come across before, pretty sure you can scratch it with a fingernail. I was going to get it paint sealed straight after buying it but then the world turned upside down and in the meantime I'm not entirely sure I'm wanting to keep it. 
 
 
Sorry if it sounds all grumble grumble for my first post here, there are plenty of positives with the car that I love - it's easy to drive, plenty nippy enough around town and acceptable on the motorway. I thought the hard plastic dash would be the thing that would most bother me but it's a non-issue, range is great, it's obviously super cheap to run. 
 
I don't know if the above are normal Zoe ""quirks"", things that can or can't be resolved. If I could even get a couple of the major ones then the minor ones probably wouldn't bother me but at the moment I just don't know if I want to keep it and it's been that way since the first couple of weeks of ownership. I've never spent more than £7k on a car previous and have loved my last few non-company cars, but having upped the budget when moving to a smaller house to be able to afford an EV, I'm quite disappointed. Not with the EV experience, I'm unlikely to go back, but with the traditional parts of the car really."

On brakes as slowing, yes. I rear ended a car as distracted while slowing in second week of ownership. No damage to Zoe. Slight stress mark on other car's bumper, which became expensive as it was a custom pain job mercedes... 
 
On brake groaning when pull away I suspect this is the hill start assist. They release as you accelerate rather than when you take foot off brake, but that transition will provide done tension between systems. 
 
Door buttons won't work if you use key fob to lock car as this disables the proximity system. Could this be the cause? If so, it's intentional. 
 
Yes to soft paint - I have scratched it with my finger nail when trying to remove a fleck of tar. I have authorisation to get one but touched up under Warranty currently ( haven't taken it in due Covid)."

The Zoe is the cheapest EV and it does show in places. It's worth messing with tyre pressures a bit to see if you can make it a bit better. Couple of psi up or down off book pressure might make all the difference. 
 
Have you downloaded the Rlink toolkit thing? A few of the quirks get ironed out with periodic updates. If the unit wasn't reset to factory before you got it it's worth doing that and starting fresh as that can sometimes make all the difference to weird behaviour."

We've had two Zoe's, the current one is the 40kWh R110 so similar to yours. I have found the ride quality and handling 'interesting' in both cars and in my view is what lets down what is generally, a very good car. What I do find is that when I go to the recycling centre with bags of rubble in the boot, it really is a good mini-van with the rear seatback removed, then the car and ride are much, much better. This all implies the rear end is the problem. 
After I realised that I then played around with tyre pressures and now have something which is OK. Unfortunately, we have the Michelin EVs so we will have the tyres going hard in winter, edges rubbing off and the generally cracking so we will be getting pair of CrossClimate+ tyres fitted this winter and will see how that goes. 
We've also had problems with the radio and the sat nav doing all sorts of things including the rebooting every few minutes but that is generally fixed by pulling fuses F26 or F31 depending on the problem. 
 
One thought on the brakes - are they corroded due to low use at the mo and need a good clean off? I have only rarely, over five years of ownership, had a problem with the transition from regen to friction but we are in a hilly area and hence the friction brakes do get used. 
 
Finally, is there anyone near you with a Zoe that you can go out in and see if it is any different?"

I cant understand why when you first switch the car on it doesn't move until the accelerator is presed but every subsequent time it stops you have to hold it on the brakes. The icing on the cake is that mine won't charge on the (free) chargers I have at work work despite them working every time for any Leaf,Tesla and NV200."

Auto hold should hold automatically and imediately as the name suggests, and relaease smoothly as soon as the accelerator is presed.

There are too many features that nearly work. I drove it whilst wearing boots today and twice had it creep forward after hold had engaged only to realise that the slightest brush on the accelrator and off it goes. I think the auto hold was designed to work with the AEB and what you have now is half the system and its positively dangerous.

I'm really not sure what to do now. 🤷‍♂️   I've already tried different tyre pressures previously with the ride/handling and will check the software shortly (but it looks up to date as of January 2020). 
Maybe I need to go test drive some others again, I did drive an i3 and an e-golf at dealers but found the experience frustrating as every time I arranged to test drive something I'd get there and the battery would be almost flat. Happened 4 times at different dealers. 
 
I really just want a small electric car that's fun to drive and own, if I wasn't going electric it'd probably be a Fiat 500 Abarth or even a twin air.

My girlfriend's car - a 2005 Skoda Octavia 1.9 diesel estate - has served us well on the very long trips we sometimes take. But a few weeks ago the engine management light came on - the EGR valve is knackered. 
 
That'll be £220 fitted. 
 
Not a huge amount to be fair, but the garage doing the work have also pointed out that the inlet manifold is about 25% the diameter it should be - I've been using it for work, now a 9 mile round trip - and it's properly gunked up because it rarely gets up to full temp. So once it's fixed, it'll be put up for sale. 
 
I think, in a decade or so, motorists will look back at the age of the diesel and wonder what the F we were thinking. DPFs, DMFs, EGRs, AdBlue systems; all this accessory crap that costs a small fortune to replace, just to hide the fact that diesels stink.

Your car probably doesn't even have a DPF, 2005 1.9tdi cars don't. 
I do get what you're saying about ICE cars being more complex, but the fact is these costs only usually come into play at very high mileage and only contribute a tiny amount in terms of pence per mile. 
And, at some point, your ICE car will need a new battery pack at how many thousands...? 
Just saying, it's not as if EVs will just run and run forever with no major expense. 
A VERY major expense will come into play at some point.

There's also the timing belt and water pump needs replacing at £500 a pop. My dirty diesel had just had DSG oil changed, this lasts 40k, timing belt is due end of 2022. I hope to switch to full EV household by 2022, I'll distribute my car mileage so that the diesel will not due major works before 2022. It has done 83k so far, I'm confident it can do 37k in the next 3.5 years, trouble free. 2019 will be ""just add fuel"" year thanks to 2yr/18k long life engine oil.

I'd call it a false economy to believe that is an expense worth avoiding. 
 
If you can manage with 1 car then just park this diesel up and use it only when you really need it. I can offer you my carefully honed and developed engineering knowledge to let you into a little secret .... it won't coke up unless you use it! 
 
We have a 2001 Grand Espace which is the most practical car, shorter than 4.8m, a person can possibly own. It's timing belt has age-expired but on the basis of low mileage I am not going to throw money at that. 
 
WBAC value it at £85. Probably about the same as your Skoda. Why bother wasting time trying to sell it when it serves a purpose just parked there?"

That and some dpf cleaner should clear it all out pretty well. As for the EGR - sometimes they go but a lot of the time they just get stuck. It's not a massive expense to just replace it anyway and if it's been stuck for a while it may well need replacing anyway.  
 
I also agree with Donald - stick it up the corner and winterise it so it's there when you want it. You can always day insure it if you only need it a few times per year though that can be expensive if you use it more often. You can tax it by the month too so when it's needed spend 10 mins on the net insuring and taxing it then when you're done simply cancel the tax and you get a refund minus any months you're part into.  
It's cheaper than hiring a car and it's always there when you like with minimal messing - just save the insurance and tax web pages in a folder in your phone.  
 
Other wise it's going to cost you an MOT per year."

It's the only thing that's stopping us ordering one... but if those demo cards were mine and I sat in traffic day after day with that squeaking every time ..I would go mad... thanks for any help

Would love to see an electric Panda. Guess they could base it on the same platform as the Corsa and 208 if the 500 platform isn't used. Give it the classic tall back end and stick as little possible past the wheels at each end.

Hi there, I have a 500e icon on lease and it was all going good untill a month ago I kept getting a onscreen warning saying something is wrong with the passenger airbag and the SOS assistance. 
 
I called fiat and they said take it to my local dealer but I didn't have time as it's 16 mile away and I go to work. But then as of a couple of week ago I was sometimes getting a seatbelt warning symbol and sound and it seemed to only happen when I was turning left lol....I tried to pull on the seatbelt in different directions and where it clips in to recreate the warning but it never happene donly when I drive and turn left. 
 
And now I keep getting all those warning but no it says one pedal driving unavailable and to use the normal break...and yep in range and Sherpa when this wanting happens I take foot of accelerator and the car keeps going...no refen breaking 
 
Just drove from work tonight and I had to drive 5 mile with all these warnings going off. I stopped my car twice turned it off but still happened. 
 
I've had the car since may I think it is...end of April start of may. 
 
And to top all that off last week lifting my boot lid I heard something rolling around inside my boot door/lid...where inside the boot you have that odd plastic that's coated in material covering the boot lid/door internals it sounds like sometjings come off inside there and rolling around when I'm driving or opening the boot. 
 
I have a feeling fiat will tell me to take it to my dealer but it's under warranty but I need a car to get to work and back so it's not like I can leave my car with them longer than 4 to 5 hours as I start work at 3pm."

The cost of engine + large batts and then more maintenance and then lugging all that extra weight around. All that for a few journeys a yr that are further than BEV range which is rapidly becoming 200mls, and anti range anxiety. Its not the cars that need to get better as much as the drivers. I despair when i see drivers screaming up to red lights and then braking hard,not helped by cars that are too heavy and small engines providing little braking. This effect is only made worse in town EVs by adding all the extra weight. 
 
In my book the correct EV is one that does 90% of your journeys without even thinking about range anxiety. Does 5% where you need to drive with consideration/sympathy and 5% it cannot do without plan B.

Once they are launched on a chosen track it is hard to change course and they will soldier on rather than admit an error. 
 
Honda are a classic example of that. Hydrogen is clearly a mistake but they misread the political desire to back it as they understood that it could be taxed easier and that it would be a politically sound way to go. Unfortunately, they failed to also understand that politicians are clueless and will change tack as often as their underpants. Honda have a lot of ground to make up and risk losing credibility if they do make the necessary U turn. 
 
Others are only dipping a toe in the water as they are forced to do by the 'compliance' rules. They deliberately make a car that is useless but satisfies the rules and then make every effort not to sell it so that they can claim no demand. Nissan seems to be in a bit of a conflict too. They have a tiger by the tail with the Leaf. But rather than build on it by leapfrogging the competition that is already announced, and maintaining their lead, the indication is that the new car will not even match the others. Not content with that they have built a car propelled entirely by petrol but using an EV final drive. Meanwhile all their existing customers have been baffled as to why they didn't build a Qashquai EV to decimate the Outlander. 
 
The whole future of EVs is still in the melting pot and it would appear that every manufacturer is still unsure on which way to push. To go full BEV, Rex, or ENote style - that is the question."

 TESLA MODEL 3 
  
Another day, another batch of Model 3 photos, and more new insights about the car’s design. This time the photos come from multiple posts on reddit by You You Xue,  u/youyouxue , who spotted the Model 3 at the San Mateo supercharger and got several high quality photos which we’ll have a look at below. 
 
 Xue said he spoke to the employee who was driving the car, and that the employee stated that the car is pretty much the final design before the first delivery (*not a direct quote from the employee, but Xue’s summary of the conversation). One thing to note is that the cockpit and steering wheel looks the same as it did in  the other recent batch of photos  we saw of them, so if this is pretty much the final design, then it’s likely that we’ll end up with a rather conventional steering wheel design on the finalized vehicle. It’s still possible that it might change, but looking less likely as we get closer and closer to release. Today’s photo of the steering wheel and interior does look the same as those other recent photos, so if Tesla is still keeping any secrets, they must be keeping them rather close to their chest."

Volvo's performance sub-brand is taking on Tesla and BMW's i with its own range of bespoke electric models 
 
 
WORDS BYDarren Moss 'What Car'

Volvo’s performance sub-brand, Polestar, will produce its own range of sporty electric vehicles, with the first model likely to be revealed later this year at the Frankfurt motor show. 
 
Electric cars made by Polestar won’t carry a Volvo logo, much in the same way that Fiat’s performance arm, Abarth, doesn’t put a Fiat badge onto its cars. However, while Abarth tunes existing Fiat products – such as the  500 hatchback  and  124 Spider  convertible – Polestar will be producing its own, bespoke vehicles. 
 
Polestar’s cars will use the same underpinnings as Volvo models – bosses have previously hinted that the first Polestars could be based on the  S90 ,  V90 ,  XC90  and  XC60  – but they’ll look substantially different inside and out, feel different to drive, and are likely to carry bigger price tags. 
 
Indeed, Polestar officials have told What Car? that this is the company “raising its head for the first time” as a bespoke car maker. 
 
 
 
Polestar’s entry into the electric car market will put it into competition with established performance-oriented electric brands such as BMW i and  Tesla . 
 
The brand’s focus on producing high-performance electric vehicles means it’s unlikely to compete with mass-market options including the  Renault Zoe  and  Nissan Leaf , but will instead focus on rivals including the  BMW i8 ,  Tesla Model S  and  Model X ."

 CHEVY BOLT EV   GM 
  
 
Albeit slowly, GM’s Chevy Bolt EV sales are still growing – reaching a new high of 1,642 units in the US last month. 
 
It brings the total delivered of the new all-electric vehicle in the US to 7,592 units since the beginning of the year and just over 8,000 since its launch in December 2016. 
 
In June,  GM opened Chevy Bolt EV orders for approved dealerships nationwide,  But that didn’t contribute to deliveries since the first shipment to the new approved dealerships are expected in August. 
 
At that point, we should have a better idea of the market for the Bolt EV. 
 
In the meantime, it’s still not clear if the vehicle is still production constraint or if it’s a demand issue. In certain markets where the vehicle is officially available, it can be difficult to get your hands on one, while in other markets, like California, there are decent inventories and some  customers have been getting away with paying $25,000 after incentives  due to discounts. You can always check with  your local dealers for inventory  and see if you can find a deal. 
 
The Chevy Bolt EV has an MSRP of $37,500 before any incentive. 
 
A few vehicles have also been shipped to Canada and to Opel in Europe, but the bulk of its market is still the US, where sales have been growing slowly month to month over the last quarter:"

 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 5:10 am ET  
 
  
 
Volkswagen’s research group displayed some of the new and cutting edge technologies that it has been working on recently – including some related to electric vehicles. 
 
They unveiled their all-electric research car, which is capable of over 250 miles of range, a first for VW’s EVs, and new mobile charging robots are presented as a possible charging solution for the vehicle. 
 
 The Golf-based vehicle serves as a test bed for VW’s upcoming electric vehicle programs, like I.D. concepts: 
 
“This provides an insight into the next generation of automobiles for efficient long-distance mobility with a range of more than 400 kilometres. The lightweight architecture has been designed for maximum crash safety including the battery. The battery is based on advanced lithium-ion cells and the efficiency of the electric motor has been optimised.” 
 
Volkswagen is also using the platform to test technologies related to electric vehicles. 
 
The most interesting is undoubtedly a “mobile robot charger.” They released a few pictures of the system: 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Despite the fact that the actual act of plugging an electric vehicle is no more cumbersome, actually arguably less, than refueling a gas-powered car, there seems to be some sort of obsession to try to automate it. 
 
There have been several different concepts, but VW’s mobile robot charger is certainly novel. The company sees some advantages for underground garages and multi-story car parks: 
 
“In future, rapid charging of the electric vehicle will be extremely convenient. Mobile robots will connect up the automobile for recharging.

 TESLA MODEL X   NORWAY 
  
While most countries have difficulties making electric cars reach 2% or 3% of their total car sales, Norway keeps pushing the bar higher and higher. 
 
Last month was another record month for the country with electric cars representing 42% of its new vehicles being registered.  
 
 That’s a significant jump from their last record in January when they reached 37% of new car sales . 
 
The country’s EV incentives, like the 25% VAT tax exemption, are helping maintain the rate of adoption about 10 times higher than most markets. 
 
In June, all-electric vehicles also reached a record 27% of new car sales with plug-in hybrids making up the difference. 
 
The record was helped by a big boost in Tesla Model X deliveries which had a record month in Norway with 609 registrations in June – enough to make it the second most popular vehicle in the country. The Model X contributed only 238 units to the last record. 
 
It was only surpassed by 874 VW e-Golfs, which remains very popular in Norway, like its gas-powered version, according to  new vehicle registrations  (Norwegian). 
 
Renault’s Zoe, which has been  dominating electric vehicle sales in several European markets , also had a good month contributing 428 vehicles to the new record. 
 
Finally, the first shipment of the Opel Ampera E, the European version of the Chevy Bolt EV, helped by adding 389 all-electric vehicles to the total, which may have resulted in an artificial increase of EVs for the month and created the record since G M is not expected to dedicate more of its Bolt production to Opel until next year.  
 
Nonetheless, Norway is really close to the tipping point of electric cars where they become the majority of car sales in the country, which has the goal to reach 100% of new car sales being zero-emission vehicles starting in 2025. 
 
With several new models coming to market in Norway next year, like Tesla Model 3, Audi e-tron quattro, and hopefully, the Opel Ampera E in higher volume, this new record of 42% of car sales could quickly seem low and the 2025 goal, which is among the most aggressive of any country, is starting to look attainable."

 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 2:17 pm ET  
 
 
  
 
When first unveiling the Tesla Model 3 in March 2016, the prototypes came equipped with new wheels designed by the automaker. 
 
CEO Elon Musk said that  they “spent a lot of time on those” and that they plan on bringing them to production . Though a lot of things have changed since and Tesla plans to limit the options available on the Model 3 – at least at the beginning. 
 
 
 
Musk confirmed last month that  wheel size is probably one of the only options that early Model 3 buyers will be able to choose – that and the color. 
 
But he didn’t say anything about the options for the designs of the wheels, which is not always the same thing as wheel size. 
 
Now we learn Tesla has obtained design patents on 3 of the Model 3 wheel designs that were previously unveiled. While it doesn’t mean they will release those wheels, it means they are securing the rights to them. 
 
Tesla applied for the patents on March 30, as they were about to unveil the Model 3, and the design patents were released over the last month. 
 
Franz Von Holzhausen, Tesla’s Chief Designer, is credited for the design of each wheel, but longtime Tesla designer David Imai and Bernard Lee are also credited for the first Model 3 wheel design – United States Patent USD789860: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
That’s the wheel designed that has been the most commonly spotted on Model 3 release candidates in the wild. 
 
The second wheel design is an aero wheel option to improve the vehicle’s aerodynamic performance – United States Patent USD788672 : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Von Holzhausen and Lee are the designers credited for the design of this wheel. 
 
While not as popular as the first wheel, it was also  spotted on several Model 3 release candidates . 
 
As for the last wheel for which Tesla obtained a design patent last month, it was unveiled at the March 2016 event, but it was never spotted on any release candidate since – United States Patent USD788671: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
It was actually only seen on plastic model of the Model 3 and not on a working prototype like the two other vehicles. 
 
Joonas Vartola, a car designer who doesn’t work for Tesla anymore, is credited for the design of this one. 
 
If the release candidates are a good indicator of the options available for the Model 3, it looks this last one is not going to be available. 
 
We should have a better idea of the wheel options for the Model 3 once Tesla starts opening the online design studio, which is expected to happen on or around the 28th when Tesla will deliver the first few vehicles."

 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 5th 2017 9:35 am ET  
 
 
  
 
Just a few weeks after unveiling  its own new battery Gigafactory for electric vehicles  in Germany, Daimler is now announcing a new $740 million battery factory project in China. 
 
The new factory will support the production of batteries for electric vehicles under the Mercedes-Benz brand. 
 
 It’s the first major project as part of Daimler’s new  investments in electric vehicles through its joint-venture with BAIC in China.  
 
Markus Schäfer, Member of the Divisional Board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Production and Supply Chain, commented on the announcement: 
 
“Building another premium eBattery factory is the next step in the implementation of our electric strategy. Thus, we have the first foreign location in our global battery production network. The local production of batteries is crucial in order to meet the demand for electric vehicles flexibly and efficiently,” 
 
While Daimler is making significant investments in battery production, they are still not producing battery cells. Like the one in Germany, the new factory will produce battery modules and packs, but they will be sourcing the cells from elsewhere. 
 
The German automaker wouldn’t confirm from which supplier, but they did say that the cells will be sourced from China. 
 
Berenberg Bank analyst  Alexander Haissl recently expressed doubts about the sourcing strategy of traditional automakers : 
 
“Clear visibility about high-volume cell-sourcing strategies continue to elude traditional manufacturers, although we expect announcements for large facilities to eventually emerge to resolve the key issue of battery supply constraints,” 
 
Daimler will be able to choose from several different battery cell manufacturers to supply its new factory. Several companies, like  Panasonic  and CATL , have been building battery cells factories in China. 
 
Hubertus Troska, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Greater China, also commented on the announcement: 
 
“We are investing in the world’s largest market for Battery Electric Vehicles, By 2025, the Chinese market will have a substantial share in sales of Mercedes-Benz electric vehicles. Therefore, local production will be key to the success of our EV portfolio, and crucial to flexibly serving local demand for electric vehicles.” 
 
They expect production at the new facility to start in 2020. 
 
The news comes just as  Tesla confirmed working with the Shanghai Government to establish its own manufacturing facility in the region.  
 
A clear rush to invest in electric vehicles is happening in China. Tesla wants to tap into what is now the world’s biggest auto market and legacy automakers are speeding up their plans to match the country’s ZEV mandate. Automakers need zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to represent 8% of new car sales as soon as 2018 and quickly ramp up to 12% by 2020."

I picked up my i3 from EVEZY last week and thought we could all do with a place to share experiences and answer any questions people may have about the process. 
 
First some background 
 
EVEZY are a short term electric car lease company with a unique business model. 
 
1) You rent the car month by month, no deposit and no minimum term (well a month minimum technically but you pay in advance) 
2) Rental includes insurance (£1000 excess though in fault claims) up to 1000 miles. month, tax and all maintenance costs 
3) you do not get a key, you use an app to lock and unlock the car. 
4) You can pick cars up and drop them off and ""depots"" around the country. 
 
You can use a referral code (see below   ) to get £50 off your first month. 
 
My experiences so far.  
 
I phoned on Wednesday and asked for a 120 i3. No problems at all; arranged pickup the next day from Windsor 
 
Took the train to Windsor only to realise it is a 4 mile trip to the pickup point, I stupidly decided to walk. The pickup point is not obvious and is actually someone's house (the cars are all parked in a big yard) There were at least 3 i3s and a few Zoes there as well. 
 
Once I find the car (the reg is on the app) it connect to the app via bluetooth and a button unlocks the car. The car was brand new and still had the plastic seat covers on so I was pleasantly surprised (note there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.) 
 
The only hitch was that the 3 pin cable to charge the car is in the front boot and the button on the app did not seem to work. I phoned them and it is a known problem that they are working on (hint to EVEZY, if this is an issue don't put the charging cable in the boot!) Fortunately I RTFM and found the emergency release wire in the cabin so used that to open and move the cable into the back boot. 
 
Car is great, there is a dash-cam but you soon forget about that, otherwise it is just like a normal i3. When I got home I was able to activate the BMW connected app and set preconditioning times etc so that all works like a normal car.  
 
Overall I am very impressed, the lease is cheaper than most other places and far more flexible, it also includes insurance so that is another saving. My only concern is the app but it is working fine so far. I have only had to enter the password once but do now carry my reading glasses everywhere I go! 
 
My referral code is in my sig. I know others have codes as well so feel free to contribute and people can pick a code at random! 
 
Please feel free to ask any more questions if you have them."

Previously I was hiring Model S whenever I needed a car through Enterprise Exotics, or whatever seemed interesting from the EV centre in MK, but then we moved somewhere that required more frequent car use (not necessarily more miles though) so went with Evezy for flexibility. Price wise is roughly the same per mile as the Enterprise rentals, but availability is obviously better if the car is outside your house! 
 
PCP you still have the ball ache of flogging it when no longer required, and I don’t like the “debt” showing on my credit report. I’ve never finished a PCP term - usually got rid after 3-6 months of a 4 year deal and never really lost out (sub £1k losses), but it’s just a bit of a pain to do so. 
 
Under normal circumstances, Evezy is still the best option, but it would just be nice to have my loyalty rewarded."

Could this situation play into the hands of evezy?"

 @E7EV  With respect that article is probably balls. Folk can stay at home or rent cars if they like, but I wager it’ll be a fearful minority not the majority. Most of us will be back on the tube to work first chance we get. 
 
Remember that most folk (including myself) were still commuting to work in London, on the tube, in late March as the curve was climbing and infection rates were basically exponential. Even with those high odds, I still don’t know a single friend or colleague who has reported symptoms (although being no older than early 30s probably helps!) 
 
By the time the “state” lets us outside again (almost as if we’re adults capable of evaluating risk all by ourselves), the actual danger will be far lower than it was in late March. 
 
The perception may well be different given all the fear mongering press, but most folk will see through it, look at the numbers, cover their face just to be sure and get on a train to work. 
 
Of course if it starts climbing again we’ll all re-evaluate, but probably choose “staying home” over “driving to work”."

Just a quick note to say that I am very pleased with my i3 and Evezy. I had a few issues with windows and doors not closing/locking, so they just came and swapped the car this morning. Everything went smoothly and the car was both cleaned and fully charged   
 
I was worried about getting hit with some fines or the app not reconnecting but they were absolutely fine in both cases. I need not have worried. Even reconnected the BMW app without any delay or fuss.

My mileage allowance for this month has shown as 1000 throughout, until I preconditioned the car remotely to charge the 12v, then it showed 999. I suspect the reason for this is GPS error tolerance - I reckon the car reported a slightly different GPS position when it switched on to precondition than it had when it was parked, and the black box therefore thought the car had moved. Perhaps only by 0.05 miles or something, but the Evezy app rounds down anyway so this was enough to cause it to display 999. 
 
They're looking into it anyway. Personally if I was them I'd increase the GPS tolerance to not count movement below 0.5mi or something.

New here, but thought I would share my experience so far of buying a used Leaf. 
 
My wife had a Fiat 500, which was becoming far too small for her and our 2 year old son, she asked if we could change it to something bigger, my immediate thought was a Leaf, I have wanted one since they were announced in the UK, however the cost of them have been quite prohibitive, but thought as there are a few used ones available, now is the time to look, so that resulted in a trip to my local Nissan dealer to see what they had in stock. 
 
I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out (note the 'I') however my wife wasn't interested in the slightest, she wanted a Corsa (huge in comparison to the 500 Convertible) so, we got her one. I then decided I wanted one so much I sold my 2 year old Zafira Tourer to get one. While this was happening the dealer sold the one I was looking at, so by the time I was ready for one two weeks later, they did a group stock search and found me one that matched my criteria exactly - Max of upto 3 years old, White, and maximum of 15k on the clock, it had done 12,000 miles. It was however at another location within the group so I put a deposit down on the 28th of Feb to get the car over to me. That process took 10 days to move the car 40 miles, which surprised me to be honest as if I thought it was actually going to take that long I would have gone to the garage it was at and looked at it there, but they did say it could take that long. 
 
As soon as the car arrived I was like a kid the night before Christmas, so excited. I shot down to the dealer to take it out for a drive. When I got there the car's bodywork was spotless, which made me very happy, however, the dealer pointed out before getting into the car it was missing it's SD Card, now as I have spent some time lurking in the background here, I know it's more than just maps stored on there and how useless the Centre Console is without it. But they promised me they could get me one in within 10 Days, so thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt and trust them. There was another issue with the steering wheel, as in it would rattle over small bumps, but they said that would be fixed. 
 
Well, lets say it will be 3 weeks on Friday since this was pointed out, I am still waiting, I resorted to contacting Nissan UK's MD office to find out what the hell is going on, the part has a 6 week lead time, not 10 days as the dealer was quoting (they were told 10 days by Nissan) So I am still without a car that I can use the basic functions on such as set the clock, listen to the radio, set charge schedules etc. 
 
There is still no sign of the card, and no time frame as to when to expect it, the steering problem has returned, the drivers seat has developed a nasty squeak on the backrest. All of the rattles and squeaks are only made worse as I cant drown them out with the radio! 
 
Nissan have agreed to lend me a demo car until the dealer can come to a resolution to the matter, the last time I heard from them was Friday, I have told them I want an exchange vehicle under the Nissan Cared for promise. 
 
I am sick of the fact that no one is giving me a date for anything! I have had a car that hasn't had any of it's advertised features for over 2 weeks now, which is not acceptable, especially as it was promised within 10 days, and that was part of the conditions of sale, I said to the salesman I would wait if he could say it would be within 10 days.  
 
My plan now is to return the car as I am not happy with it, I am not happy with the service I have had, and it sure as hell isn't as advertised. 
 
Lesson of the story is STAY WELL CLEAR of Leaf's that are missing the SD Cards."

When I got mine a few years ago, the only choice really was a Zoe or a Leaf. I'm going to get something newer over the summer. Pretty much, this is what I'd like: 
 
Supermini or City Car sized. 
Can charge as quickly as possible from whatever AC or DC charger is nearby 
200+ mile real world range 
available with a big discount through carwow or similar. 
 
What would you recommend?"
