I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today. 
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range. 
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc.  
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no  problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk. 
 
Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly. 
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV. 
 
And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster) 
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that. 
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that! 
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise. 
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one.  
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?%  
 
As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!"

And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat.  
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell! 
 
Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode."

The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks… 
 
Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car."

Key take aways from the linked video at the 150kW Charger 
 
 Car plugged in at 7% - Initial charge rate of 82kW 
 26 Minutes to 81% - At 81% Charge rate of 42.5kW with 27.7 kWh delivered in that time 
 42/43kW until 85%, seems as though it is a staircase shaped charge curve

We are very excited! 
We already did a tour from Italy to the UK for a month last year (everything went very well) and this year we want to top that. 
We want to show - the 500e is more than a shopping car! 
 
But of course an EV driver on a road trip needs so much more preparation than with a conventional car. That's why I've opened a travel journal and although we're not on the road yet, I'm already posting important steps, tips and advice for preparation. How to plan, where to charge, which apps in which country etc.

I’m 6 ft 3 and couldn’t fit in the petrol version as my head kept touching the ceiling. I’m truly surprised with the electric version, even with the seat adjusted high I still had headroom and it was spacey for my long legs. 
 
She charges once a week as she only covers town driving and it costs her £8 with the Elli card/app. Electroverse is good too. 
 
The only drawback with the action and icon models is the halogen headlights (yellow not white led). The LED headlights is on the Prima version and that’s a lot more costly, still covers 199 miles and it’s got a more plush interior."

Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to :  How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper   
 
Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?  
 
Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991  https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

I can't recall if the 500e has rapid charging, but if it's CCS Type 1 you will not be able to rapid charge anywhere (we use CCS Type 2). Also while the Type 1 inlet will accept 230v, will it be happy at 50hz rather than 60? I'd hope so but not sure."

As the Fiat Professional e-Scudo is another van from Stellantis, using the same platform as the Citroen e-Dispatch, Peugeot e-Expert, Vauxhall Vivaro-e, Toyota Proace, etc, the assumption was that it’ll essentially be the same as the others apart from the logo.  
 
So, cosmetically it does look like any of the others apart from the Fiat logo on the front grill and rear. Also feature-wise, as expected, they are all much in much the same.  
 
One exception seems to be that the Fiat e-Scudo version doesn’t have an app of any description. So you can’t check even the basic of settings remotely, or access firmware or map updates when they are released for their sibling Stellantis brands. 
 
As far as I can tell the e-Scudo does already have the necessary hardware built-in, it’s just that Fiat seem to have no intention of enabling the features or releasing an app any time soon."

Hi there, I have a 500e icon on lease and it was all going good untill a month ago I kept getting a onscreen warning saying something is wrong with the passenger airbag and the SOS assistance. 
 
I called fiat and they said take it to my local dealer but I didn't have time as it's 16 mile away and I go to work. But then as of a couple of week ago I was sometimes getting a seatbelt warning symbol and sound and it seemed to only happen when I was turning left lol....I tried to pull on the seatbelt in different directions and where it clips in to recreate the warning but it never happene donly when I drive and turn left. 
 
And now I keep getting all those warning but no it says one pedal driving unavailable and to use the normal break...and yep in range and Sherpa when this wanting happens I take foot of accelerator and the car keeps going...no refen breaking 
 
Just drove from work tonight and I had to drive 5 mile with all these warnings going off. I stopped my car twice turned it off but still happened. 
 
I've had the car since may I think it is...end of April start of may. 
 
And to top all that off last week lifting my boot lid I heard something rolling around inside my boot door/lid...where inside the boot you have that odd plastic that's coated in material covering the boot lid/door internals it sounds like sometjings come off inside there and rolling around when I'm driving or opening the boot. 
 
I have a feeling fiat will tell me to take it to my dealer but it's under warranty but I need a car to get to work and back so it's not like I can leave my car with them longer than 4 to 5 hours as I start work at 3pm."

I picked up my i3 from EVEZY last week and thought we could all do with a place to share experiences and answer any questions people may have about the process. 
 
First some background 
 
EVEZY are a short term electric car lease company with a unique business model. 
 
1) You rent the car month by month, no deposit and no minimum term (well a month minimum technically but you pay in advance) 
2) Rental includes insurance (£1000 excess though in fault claims) up to 1000 miles. month, tax and all maintenance costs 
3) you do not get a key, you use an app to lock and unlock the car. 
4) You can pick cars up and drop them off and ""depots"" around the country. 
 
You can use a referral code (see below   ) to get £50 off your first month. 
 
My experiences so far.  
 
I phoned on Wednesday and asked for a 120 i3. No problems at all; arranged pickup the next day from Windsor 
 
Took the train to Windsor only to realise it is a 4 mile trip to the pickup point, I stupidly decided to walk. The pickup point is not obvious and is actually someone's house (the cars are all parked in a big yard) There were at least 3 i3s and a few Zoes there as well. 
 
Once I find the car (the reg is on the app) it connect to the app via bluetooth and a button unlocks the car. The car was brand new and still had the plastic seat covers on so I was pleasantly surprised (note there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.) 
 
The only hitch was that the 3 pin cable to charge the car is in the front boot and the button on the app did not seem to work. I phoned them and it is a known problem that they are working on (hint to EVEZY, if this is an issue don't put the charging cable in the boot!) Fortunately I RTFM and found the emergency release wire in the cabin so used that to open and move the cable into the back boot. 
 
Car is great, there is a dash-cam but you soon forget about that, otherwise it is just like a normal i3. When I got home I was able to activate the BMW connected app and set preconditioning times etc so that all works like a normal car.  
 
Overall I am very impressed, the lease is cheaper than most other places and far more flexible, it also includes insurance so that is another saving. My only concern is the app but it is working fine so far. I have only had to enter the password once but do now carry my reading glasses everywhere I go! 
 
My referral code is in my sig. I know others have codes as well so feel free to contribute and people can pick a code at random! 
 
Please feel free to ask any more questions if you have them."

It’s a sticky wicket though. How would they handle it? 
 
It makes sense to charge the money owed from the freeze period once the customer hands the car back, but 1) they could be waiting a while and 2) a lump sum payment won’t go down well with customers. 
 
Do they increase the monthly charge after a freeze period to compensate? Possibly - but they may not ever get the money back if the customer returns the car!

Previously I was hiring Model S whenever I needed a car through Enterprise Exotics, or whatever seemed interesting from the EV centre in MK, but then we moved somewhere that required more frequent car use (not necessarily more miles though) so went with Evezy for flexibility. Price wise is roughly the same per mile as the Enterprise rentals, but availability is obviously better if the car is outside your house! 
 
PCP you still have the ball ache of flogging it when no longer required, and I don’t like the “debt” showing on my credit report. I’ve never finished a PCP term - usually got rid after 3-6 months of a 4 year deal and never really lost out (sub £1k losses), but it’s just a bit of a pain to do so.

 @E7EV  With respect that article is probably balls. Folk can stay at home or rent cars if they like, but I wager it’ll be a fearful minority not the majority. Most of us will be back on the tube to work first chance we get. 
 
Remember that most folk (including myself) were still commuting to work in London, on the tube, in late March as the curve was climbing and infection rates were basically exponential. Even with those high odds, I still don’t know a single friend or colleague who has reported symptoms (although being no older than early 30s probably helps!) 
 
By the time the “state” lets us outside again (almost as if we’re adults capable of evaluating risk all by ourselves), the actual danger will be far lower than it was in late March. 
 
The perception may well be different given all the fear mongering press, but most folk will see through it, look at the numbers, cover their face just to be sure and get on a train to work. 
 
Of course if it starts climbing again we’ll all re-evaluate, but probably choose “staying home” over “driving to work”."

I'd say right up until the first LEAF, they were a distinctly Japanese manufacturer leading the way in a lot of fields. I'm not even talking about the old Silvias and ""iconic"" JDM stuff - the GT-R and 370Z weren't that long ago, for example..! Since then, the Japanese-designed stuff seems to have been half-arsed (eg LEAF 2) and the rest is just ""too many cooks"" Eurotrash (Qashqai etc). 
 
I'd love to buy a Nissan circa 1980-2010. It was a mark of quality. No more, though... whether that's the fault of Ghosn or the xenophobes who ousted him that have now taken the reins, I'm not sure."

My mileage allowance for this month has shown as 1000 throughout, until I preconditioned the car remotely to charge the 12v, then it showed 999. I suspect the reason for this is GPS error tolerance - I reckon the car reported a slightly different GPS position when it switched on to precondition than it had when it was parked, and the black box therefore thought the car had moved. Perhaps only by 0.05 miles or something, but the Evezy app rounds down anyway so this was enough to cause it to display 999. 
 
They're looking into it anyway. Personally if I was them I'd increase the GPS tolerance to not count movement below 0.5mi or something.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice. I collect my Fiat 500e this weekend, it comes with a free wall charger (The EasyWallBox be Engie). However I am struggling to get anyone to Install it. 
 
It can be plugged into a standard mains outlet for 2.3KW, or installed properly for 7KW. It has a DPM sensor for monitoring the load on the main fuse. 
 
Ive got a call with Western Power (I am in South Wales) to takes us off a loop and upgrade our fuse to 80A (From 63A), and so far I have had two installers say they cannot help as they are not 'accredited' for that charger. I contacted Fiat and they said to contact Engie, Engie said they do not keep a list of installer and instead just sent me the Installation manual for installers. All the other installers ive contacted have either not responded to their ""contact me"" form, or don't answer the phone 
 
Has anyone had any luck getting this charger installed? 
 
I appreciate that most people would just get a podpoint or something installed instead of the Fiat one if they had to buy one."

This wouldn't be the first time that a manufacturer has tried to create a closed shop like this. A heat pump manufacturer (more accurately a UK distributor) tried the same trick with me years ago, and tried to make out that the product only had a warranty if installed by one of their accredited installers. As I'd bought the thing from a wholesaler, had all the competences and qualifications needed to install it, and had no intention of spending as much as I'd paid for it to get a (pretty pointless for me) chit just to do one installation, I challenged them. Have to say they didn't even argue about it when challenged. I offered to send them photos, but they just backed right off and made it clear that they legally had to honour the warranty as long as the unit was installed as per their MIs. 
 
If anyone gets this sort of challenge from any charge point supplier/manufacturer then I think they need to challenge it. The one proviso is that manufacturers can choose to offer an extended warranty, over and above any statutory warranty, that may be dependent on certain conditions being met. Even then I believe that the onus would be on them to prove that the installation was in some way non-compliant with their MIs, and that the failure was a consequence of shortcomings in the installation. That's probably a pretty tough thing for them to prove, especially if the installer has taken photos at the time (I do this all the time now, as much to assist my memory as anything else). 
 
As an aside, the tendency by manufacturers to try and create closed shops is something that seems to be getting more common. I'm pleased to see that the ""Right to Repair"" movement seems to be countering this to some extent. When my Macbook needs replacing it won't be with another one, that's for sure, it will most probably be this ""designed to be repaired/upgraded"" laptop:  Framework Laptop pre-orders are now open  , primarily because I do not like the way Apple are trying very hard to stop anyone other than their own stores fixing their stuff."

Installers arent going to want to argue t&cs with the manufacturer, regardless of law, easier just to get accredited accordingly... 
 
With regards to doing the accreditation, it all depends on how busy that installer is... they will just say no to spending a few hours sending certs off and doing additional online courses (or whatever the manufacturer requires them to do) if they are too busy.

New here, but thought I would share my experience so far of buying a used Leaf. 
 
My wife had a Fiat 500, which was becoming far too small for her and our 2 year old son, she asked if we could change it to something bigger, my immediate thought was a Leaf, I have wanted one since they were announced in the UK, however the cost of them have been quite prohibitive, but thought as there are a few used ones available, now is the time to look, so that resulted in a trip to my local Nissan dealer to see what they had in stock. 
 
I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out (note the 'I') however my wife wasn't interested in the slightest, she wanted a Corsa (huge in comparison to the 500 Convertible) so, we got her one. I then decided I wanted one so much I sold my 2 year old Zafira Tourer to get one. While this was happening the dealer sold the one I was looking at, so by the time I was ready for one two weeks later, they did a group stock search and found me one that matched my criteria exactly - Max of upto 3 years old, White, and maximum of 15k on the clock, it had done 12,000 miles. It was however at another location within the group so I put a deposit down on the 28th of Feb to get the car over to me. That process took 10 days to move the car 40 miles, which surprised me to be honest as if I thought it was actually going to take that long I would have gone to the garage it was at and looked at it there, but they did say it could take that long. 
 
As soon as the car arrived I was like a kid the night before Christmas, so excited. I shot down to the dealer to take it out for a drive. When I got there the car's bodywork was spotless, which made me very happy, however, the dealer pointed out before getting into the car it was missing it's SD Card, now as I have spent some time lurking in the background here, I know it's more than just maps stored on there and how useless the Centre Console is without it. But they promised me they could get me one in within 10 Days, so thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt and trust them. There was another issue with the steering wheel, as in it would rattle over small bumps, but they said that would be fixed. 
 
Well, lets say it will be 3 weeks on Friday since this was pointed out, I am still waiting, I resorted to contacting Nissan UK's MD office to find out what the hell is going on, the part has a 6 week lead time, not 10 days as the dealer was quoting (they were told 10 days by Nissan) So I am still without a car that I can use the basic functions on such as set the clock, listen to the radio, set charge schedules etc. 
 
There is still no sign of the card, and no time frame as to when to expect it, the steering problem has returned, the drivers seat has developed a nasty squeak on the backrest. All of the rattles and squeaks are only made worse as I cant drown them out with the radio! 
 
Nissan have agreed to lend me a demo car until the dealer can come to a resolution to the matter, the last time I heard from them was Friday, I have told them I want an exchange vehicle under the Nissan Cared for promise. 
 
I am sick of the fact that no one is giving me a date for anything! I have had a car that hasn't had any of it's advertised features for over 2 weeks now, which is not acceptable, especially as it was promised within 10 days, and that was part of the conditions of sale, I said to the salesman I would wait if he could say it would be within 10 days.  
 
My plan now is to return the car as I am not happy with it, I am not happy with the service I have had, and it sure as hell isn't as advertised. 
 
Lesson of the story is STAY WELL CLEAR of Leaf's that are missing the SD Cards."

Few days ago I started to feel a judder when at low speeds/pulling away. Only noticed it when on electric, it kind of feels like trying to pull away in an ICE in too high a gear, although the display says it's in 1st. This happens whether I'm using ACC or manually accelerating. Like others, it goes away above around 5 mph. I'll give it a couple of weeks to see whether it's temporary, otherwise it'll be a trip to the dealer :-(.  
 
This is my first time with an automatic gearbox, but I've also noticed sluggishness in a few situations. For example with a typical manual ICE, I could stick it in reverse to pull out of a parking space, bung it in 1st when still rolling backwards, and away we go forwards. In the GTE I've nearly crashed while attempting similar manoeuvres. While gently rolling backwards in reverse I moved the stick to D and hit the go pedal - nothing happens. I probably went another 4-5 feet backwards before the car finally got the message. This also happens if gently moving forwards, putting it in reverse & hitting Go. There's a noticeable lag in response. Anyone else experienced this? Wondering if it could be connected to an issue with the gearbox, or whether it's my inexperience of an automatic! 
 
Cheers"

Also, older GTE's don't do it, and if it was expected behavior then surely it would have done it in the first couple of weeks of ownership, not just starting at week 3 ?

I know it’s of no help at all, but my 2015 model GTE has felt unburstable and it has never ever juddered.  
 
You’d hope that any franchised VW dealer know what they’re doing, but a previous car I had (a Polo GTI with DSG box) went in for a judder in first and second gear at low speeds.  
 
They diagnosed a faulty clutch pack, which was duly replaced but the DSG box was playing up even worse on the test drive.  
 
The DSG box had to be re-calibrated using a software procedure that nobody in the dealership had done before, it took them a few days to finally get it right."

My wife has a new basic Fiat 500 that is fine for what she requires, but it is SO under powered it is crazy !. 
But truly, I do feel we are visiting the petrol station MORE often for her car than my GTE !. 
The last time the GTE was in for service, the dealer gave me a 1.0 Litre three cylinder Polo to use for the day. 
Granted, you could buy 3 Polo's for what the GTE costs new, but after driving that car for even 1 day - I was SO glad to get my GTE back !. Honestly, it did feel like it consumed MORE petrol in that one day than my GTE would have done so over the same driven distance. Okay, I know this is because my car would have been running a lot of that time on electric power, but you do quickly become use to this method of propulsion and therefore DO spend less time visiting the petrol stations as a result !. 
I STILL think the the GTE is a pretty hard act to follow, given it has been out now for WELL over three years !. 
Strange situation really, the GTE was something that really took it's time getting started and in turn liked by the early buyers. The feed back from the motoring press was pretty positive, but the take up of the GTE was slow, but after it had been released just after a year, very quickly the demand for the car went stupid CRAZY !. 
The massive and sudden increase in it's demand, I think was part of it's demise in the end ????. 
Normal, I would have replaced my GTE at three years - but prior to reaching the car's 3rd birthday, there was nothing out there that could offer me anything more than my car had to offer at that present moment in time I.M.H.O. 
This is why I still have my car now when it is WELL over three years old ( that is a real first for me ). 
The problem I see with owning a GTE myself is simply this, returning to a full on only fossil car is NOT an option really anymore. So I guess to this level then the GTE has done a really great job, a brilliant ( toe in the water / introduction ) into the world of electric propulsion, also with the addition of a fossil fuel back up should you need it for them longer trips. 
For me anyway, a full B.E.V. has to be the next step really - but right now I feel that I am sitting in a waiting room, being caught out between the now decreasing amount of hybrid cars available and the small choice of affordable BEV's that has a range to suit my needs. 
Okay, the new Kona has just been recently been released at a price that is NOT stupid / crazy and does indeed have a very good electrical mileage range between each charge. 
Getting your hands on a 64 KW Kona is a totally different ball game I believe !!!. 
They ARE in front of other manufacture's right now with regards to bringing an E.V. to the market that is both affordable to the majority of the people, BUT can also cover a real world reasonable distance on a single charge. 
For this alone, they should be very welcomed and commended for doing so. 
The wait list is very long for the Kona I understand, but there IS more models from other manufacture's to follow in 2019 - 2020. 
It's a really strange feeling right now, I just feel like the new nervous prospective father sitting outside of the labour ward in a hospital !. 
You know something great is going to happen very soon, but the waiting is killing you and are not sure when and what the new delivery is likely to be !!!!. Ha Ha !."

With your help, we'd like to fix that. 
 
Stellantis brands are Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, RAM, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. 
 
Stellantis are rapidly becoming a major BEV manufacturer. Fiat will be an EV only brand in Europe by 2026. That is full BEVs, not hybrids. 
 
 
 
I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum. That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out.

Treat these vehicles the same as everything else. 
From the perspective of what I drive this would mean having a Vauxhall forum with sub forums for Mokka and another for Corsa etc. 
Vans should be treated however they already are. 
Similar for Peugeot and Citroën 
The stellantis name shouldn't even come into it. 
 
Clearly if someone has an issue with a pug 208 and the issue might also relate to a corsa they can search appropriately. 
 
By grouping things together it makes things a lot less clear and more difficult and for no reasonable benefit. 
 
Another example is where posts that should have gone straight into the mokka forum were in random places because the poster could not locate the correct place. 
 
The issue is the amount of work to do initially but once organised correctly the only extra work to do is add a new sub forum for a new car.

It will likely make more sense when the cars are older as well. 
 
I think this forum, these days is more about the consumer side where people will take their cars to garages, often dealers and so it is more appropriate for the cars to be grouped by make and model.  
 
Just because the e-208 and Corsa e share fundamental components, that doesn't matter for customers discussing dealers, discounts and the like nor does it have much to do with servicing and maintenance when they are so new. Having all Vauxhall and Peugeot posts in one forum muddies those discussions considerably.  
 
I originally voted for group cars and vans by body because that makes sense to me as a nerd/more technical person but I have changed to car and vans get separate sub-forums based on responses to this thread and considering the purpose of this forum overall. Also, one big benefit of computers, we can have as many sub-fora as we want! 
 
It's interesting to consider the long term implications for this forum really, when all new cars are EVs this could be a busy place, but I guess people will split off as all the dedicated manufacturer forums will have sub-forums for the EVs. SpeakEV can remain as a manufacturer agnostic place for general discussion of EV motoring in the UK (mostly)."

I have never driven a Corsa so although I know the car and technology are the same I'm not aware how different the driving experience might be. Does the Corsa come with all the same dashboard, interior functions and options as a 208 or is the experience of buying and riving the car quite different (and I don't mean from a performance or handling perspective). 
 
If the purchasing options, driving performance (perspective?) and choice to me as a buyer are not the same then they should not share a thread. 
 
If, however this forum is for the real technical differences on how they are built, how they drive, range, 0-60 then they perhaps should share a forum. However, most questions I see on here tend to be about the experience of buying and driving the car in which case Stellantis want us to think they are different (nowhere on the Peugeot website does it tell me it's the same platform as the Vauxhall , Citroen, Fiat etc) then perhaps we should differentiate?"

A Corsa-E for example has a completely different dashboard system to the e208 or a e-c4. The Corsa-e also has, I believe, multiple settings on the stalks for things like the intermittent wiper function where Peugeots and Citroens are speed sensitive and adjust automatically. Intellilux lights are different to the Matrix LEDs used across the group. These are just day to day examples but they illustrate the point.  
 
I originally voted for ‘by body’ - but I think perhaps from a consumers perspective what sits underneath is an irrelevance. When you are needing help you want to understand and get guidance on what you touch and feel.

With your help, we'd like to fix that. 
 
Stellantis brands are Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, RAM, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. 
 
Stellantis are rapidly becoming a major BEV manufacturer. Fiat will be an EV only brand in Europe by 2026. That is full BEVs, not hybrids. 
 
 
 
I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum.  That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out.

I've asked  @Admin  to  
 
1) Change PSA To Stellantis. PSA no longer exist. 
 
Old Name 
 PSA Peugeot Citroën EV Forum  
For discussing Peugeot and branded EVs and PHEVs 
 
 
New Top level Name: 
 
Stellantis: Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat, Vauxhall and Opel 
 
2) Split the Corsa-E and Mokka-E into two sub-forums. 
 
Rename the current one to Corsa-E. Make a new Mokka-E sub-forum. I'll move posts as needed. 
 
3) Create a new Citroën Ami sub-forum in the Stellantis area."

It still leaves a bit of work to round up all the Vx Pug etc post which went into the general ev section and maybe elsewhere but truly the number of posts are so few it probably doesn't matter. 
The feeling is people looked for Vx etc, didn't find it and moved on rather than posting in the general group. 
After the update people will easily spot what they need to particularly if they realise nothing is in alphabetical order and will look much further down to find Citroën.

Its also much more nuanced than it once was...

Perhaps signs should be in place asking people to only charge above 85% if strictly necessary for their onward journey and to move to a slower chargerpoint if available. 
Of course, there's always going to be those who insist they need 100%  
One way to deal with things would be to make pricing increase from start to finish of the session. 
First 5 kW free next 5 at 10p then the next at an increasing rate which would encourage folk to move to a new session on slower equipment to get their 100% 
Sure you'd get people moving around all the time to minimise cost but it would free things up for others to start charging. 
Heavy fines for anyone just stretching leads.

I had to move and luckily the 1st spot was free and working. A couple of weeks ago it was not so I would have been stuck.  
 
I don't know why they choose the middle charger the end one was working and cable would have easily reached.  
 
I guess education will help eventually.  
 
Mind you I broke etiquette as my appointment overran and I effectively blocked a spot as the car had stopped charging. I don't think it effected anyone as when I got back the fiat had gone and there were two spots available.

Met many people at chargers plugging in just so they can park close or just because the charger is unoccupied. They don't need the range to get where they are going. Then someone who is empty is forced to wait unnecessarily. With limited charge points if people can not charge when not required it will help all people get more chance of getting a charge when needed. I've seen a lot of people suggest to always be charging eg. Plug in whenever you can which I feel gives the wrong use case on rapids. On a destination charger sure

As I've mentioned many times, a time element need to be introduced on rapid chargers. Lessons are most effective when it costs money.  
 
 
How would that work? I'm not sure, I originally thought a flat per-minute rate would be good. But it is unfair to cars that are rapid-gating, not fault of the owner. Perhaps a per-minute sur-charge that gets introduced when charge rate drops below a certain point, let's say 10% of rapid charger capacity? (Eg. below 5 kW for a 50 kW unit, below 15 kW for a 150 kW unit)  
Just throwing ideas out there, open to suggestions.  
 
 
But root of the problem is lack of rapid charger stalls at each location. I quite like Supercharger V2 and Kempower's way of splitting available power to multiple stalls. This enables more cars plugged in and at very least starting a charge.  
More cars = more chargers at each location are required. It's really simple."

I test drove Opel Corsa-e (registered in 2020 November) and I loved it! I currently have fiat 500, with 13.5s to 100... Corsa was on another level, heaps above that. And I loved how it hugged the road... I was a bit shocked by how fast the range was dropping, driving it in sports through some bends and ups and downs... and a few km at 150 and 130 on the motorway... but okay, it is what it is... and I was researching charging stations after I came home, and it's not that bad to charge it... and 95% of the time we will charge it at home. the lack of battery % is the dumbest thing ever though, and I've now read that the range estimates are wonky at best 
 
now for the main issue... infotainment/main screen was VERY lackluster. There is a phone, nav, photos/SMS, music, and very few car settings, like auto-dimming the lights, auto-locking, etc... 
I and wifey were trying to get some battery management stuff to come up, but we could only get some basic version of it on the driver's screen. 
we went into the handbook, and there was mention of ""eflow"" button, etc... but our car simply didn't have that. Our car seems to have a smaller screen and no buttons to the left and right of the volume knob. 
 
I then went searching for reviews online and they all have those buttons... so what the f. is up with that?
