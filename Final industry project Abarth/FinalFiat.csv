"How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands! 
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today. 
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range. 
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc.  
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no  problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk. 
 
Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly. 
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV. 
 
And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster) 
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that. 
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that! 
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise. 
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one.  
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?%  
 
As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!",2021,4,24
"Nice review, I am having a test drive on Tuesday, can I ask what sort of discounts were offered, see we were both looking at the Ioniq 5 on an other forum.",2021,4,24
I saw Jonny Smith’s early review of this and thought it looked great.,2021,4,24
I work in the NHS and with their finance package -Affinity? Would give a £2k discount Straight off For NHS workers. I Will have to read up on it. New car/new model but I am sure as Fiat dealers they can still do a deal.,2021,4,24
"I noticed this site seems to have some really good prices - £23.5k for the La Prima hatch. No connection and I've never used them before, so can't vouch for them.",2021,4,24
"We’ve also got our test drive on Tuesday. Car has been on order now for over a year now and Mrs is very excited, especially after reading this review. As I said on another thread, I think Fiat have got this spot on.",2021,4,25
"Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable.  
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat.  
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell! 
 
Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.",2021,4,25
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.,2021,4,25
Did you find the start up chimes/sound and low speed sounds to be irritating? Or aren’t they that noticeable?,2021,4,25
Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.,2021,4,25
"Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.",2021,4,26
Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now ,2021,4,26
"Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.",2021,4,27
"What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm.  
 
Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.",2021,4,27
"We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything  @MarkyM  said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks… 
 
Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.",2021,4,27
Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.,2021,5,21
"Although the CEO of Fiat says he is losing money on every one, reports would suggest it would sell like hot cakes in many markets but is only a compliance car at the moment. 
 
The following link  100-Plus Racers Just Bought Fiat 500e Electric Cars  suggests that for around £750 down and £55 a month you can have the lovely Fiat 500 EV. 
 
Can you imagine how many would be snapped up at that price in the UK!",2015,3,18
"It's great to live in California...  
 
You just have to put up with brush fires, a multi-year drought, earthquakes, mudslides, and locusts... (maybe not the latter...yet). 
 
The Fiat 500e is pretty fun to drive.",2015,3,18
"Never been to California, but I'd like to. If I could try a 500e at the same time.... ",2015,3,18
"Noticed that quite a few initial reviews of the new electric Fiat 500 are now on Youtube from the German reviewers. 
 
The most interesting one that I came across is linked below (links jumps to charging section), however due to its length the auto generated closed captions aren't available. 
 
Key take aways from the linked video at the 150kW Charger 
 
 Car plugged in at 7% - Initial charge rate of 82kW 
 26 Minutes to 81% - At 81% Charge rate of 42.5kW with 27.7 kWh delivered in that time 
 42/43kW until 85%, seems as though it is a staircase shaped charge curve 
 At 85% charge rate drops to 13kW 
 Around 29 minutes from 7% to 85% - 29.4 kWh delivered in that time

Some info on the new Fiat 500 electric. One we've all be waiting for:,2020,4,24
"Did I mention the £29,000 was after the PiCG?   
 
I expect once the dust settles, they will over stocking PCP deals in order to offset emissions for the rest of the FCA group. ",2020,4,24
"We will soon start our 5 month EV road trip from Italy to Germany, The Netherlands, Northern England, Scotland, all Scottish Islands (like Orkney, Shetland etc.), Northern Ireland, Wales and Ireland. And back. 
 
8000 miles. 10 countries. 192 photo spots. All electrical with the Fiat 500e.  
 
We are very excited! 
We already did a tour from Italy to the UK for a month last year (everything went very well) and this year we want to top that. 
We want to show - the 500e is more than a shopping car! 
 
But of course an EV driver on a road trip needs so much more preparation than with a conventional car. That's why I've opened a travel journal and although we're not on the road yet, I'm already posting important steps, tips and advice for preparation. How to plan, where to charge, which apps in which country etc.

I can't wait to start the journey! 
What are your experiences? Do you already have a long EV road trip behind you?

"Haha - I know Alnair, I am from the UK (New Forest). 
I just LOVE the vegan options in the UK and I miss it every single day here in my exile... Sunny but not (yet) vegan-friendly Italy. 
This time no London for us. 
Last year we took the ferry from Calais to Dover, but this time from the Netherlands to Newcastle, so we will be already up North in England. 
 
I am curious how I will survive on the Scottish Isles and in the Highlands. Last time I had been there I was still a vegetarian and it was ok ish. 
But as a vegan?!? 
I will report in my travel journey. 
It is with live tracking, so you can watch me starving almost live :-D

"I'm sure you'll be perfectly fine 😆  
I went vegan while living in Italy, more specifically in Emilia Romagna, where meat is king 😭 - and I've hitchhiked through all of south-eastern Europe, which is not the most vegan-friendly part of the world... no doubts you'll cope in Scotland (where I'm also headed this summer!)",2023,3,6
"I’ve just got a 500e so wondering how you’ll fit everything in. Presumably you’re two up. Do you permanently fold the back seat down, or is it possible to remove it entirely?",2023,3,6
"If you’re stopping in Belfast while in NI be sure to check out Jumon. Not fully vegan but mostly and very tasty food. you’ve timed it reasonably well, there’s just the start of a half decent collection of rapid chargers here.",2023,3,7
In deed it is very likely that we will stop in Belfast! Thanks for the advice regarding vegan food - can't wait!,2023,3,7
"@EV-Travellers   
Interesting what you are planning. 
Will you also drive through Luxembourg? I couldn't see that on the page you linked. 
You make me confident I can drive to the North Sea Jazz in Rotterdam in July without major problems, I'll pick up my 500e Cabrio next week Friday.",2023,3,7
"Hi ophone, no, Lucembourg is not on our way. We go from Central Italy through Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands and from there we'll take the ferry to Newcastle. 
 
So you'll have the same car like me - 500e Cabriolet. Enjoy it, it is a great little car - and more spacious inside as you think. Very comfortable. 
I have no doubt whatsoever that you'll manage to go to Rotterdam. 
Just prepare yourself with the apps and RFID cards you might need.  
If you follow my journal - that will be (and it already was a bit) a part of it. Maybe you'll get some ideas.",2023,3,7
"For a morning I had the opportunity to try a test car with the same configuration I ordered. 
You're right, it's rather spacious inside, at least for the driver and the co-driver.",2023,3,7
"For short distance we were also already in four - once you got into the car, it is not too bad on the rear seats. But I wouldn't do it for longer than 30 mins or so. 
For our trip we removed the back of the back seat, so now it is anyway a two seater ",2023,3,7
"We’re thinking of replacing my wife’s 2011 toyota verso S with an EV as it should suit her low mileage (circa 3k per year). We’re thinking of the fiat 500 electric as the icon 42kWh versions are currently circa £20k used for a 2022 model low mileage (<10k miles). 
 
I thought I’d ask opinions on it and if it’s a good choice.",2023,4,3
"If only 3k miles per year, would a cheaper 24kwh one do? 
That mileage suggests short commutes.",2023,4,3
Make sure you have a drive in a Mini Cooper SE to compare.,2023,4,3
"My sister drove a Renault Zoe for a year with Onto and recently leased a Fiat 500e. She drives mostly alone and says it’s perfect. It’s got 199 miles range which is perfect for around town and a quick trip from London to Brighton. 
 
I’m 6 ft 3 and couldn’t fit in the petrol version as my head kept touching the ceiling. I’m truly surprised with the electric version, even with the seat adjusted high I still had headroom and it was spacey for my long legs. 
 
She charges once a week as she only covers town driving and it costs her £8 with the Elli card/app. Electroverse is good too. 
 
The only drawback with the action and icon models is the halogen headlights (yellow not white led). The LED headlights is on the Prima version and that’s a lot more costly, still covers 199 miles and it’s got a more plush interior.",2023,4,3
e-up? Similar size and probably cheaper,2023,4,4
"Yes I drive one 42kwh version (My wife's car). Fits me a hefty 6ft 4ins. 160m range with ease. Today I got two dining room chairs in the back down to the dump. Lots of room. First EV? Yeah a good contender but do drive a Corsa-e as well. I also have a Mokka-e which on paper looks similar. It isn't. The Mokka makes a comfy Cruiser but the 500e is a good city car. 
I agree about the headlights. Standard ones are insufficient you need the LED version.",2023,4,4
"I have just purchased a 71 plate 500e and wondered if there was an app that allows you to control charging from your phone. 
First post so sorry if it is a bit naive",2023,4,18
Yes there is. Just search for Fiat car in the app store (android) no idea about ios.,2023,4,18
"Thanks, I’ve downloaded uconnect live but I cant connect with the vehicle. 
might have to search YouTube",2023,4,18
You need the app just called Fiat as well as unconnect.,2023,4,18
"When you get the car from new, the dealer sets you up an account with Fiat, so that you can access the app etc. Essentially associating your car with your email address. I'm not sure what happens on a used car, but when owners have had issues with the dealer not setting them up correctly, fiat customer services have resolved it.",2023,4,18
"The Fiat 500e looks a fantastic little EV with a decent circa 100 mile range and 4 hour home charging. 
 
Sadly it's only available in California and Fiat don't want you to buy one as they're making a loss! 
 
Does anyone know if Fiat plans to bring it over the pond?",2015,8,6
"None at all. It's a California compliance car. If they don't build it and sell it they can't sell any cars there, or not as easily. 
 
They could sell it here too, but choose not to. They're not alone. There's a UK RHD Ford Focus EV that's been available for 2 years, not that you'd know it. They've sold about 19 in that time.",2015,8,6
"Sadly, no, we'd be a two EV household if they did!",2015,8,7
"I was wrong, they're up to 23 cars in 2 years; 
 FORD FOCUS ELECTRIC - How Many Left?  
 
The RHD Focus EV is a very very rare beast indeed. 
 
Nissan and Renault get a lot of rap but some manufacturers like Fiat and Ford have the cars, the technology but absolutely no intention of selling them unless forced.",2015,8,7
"I expect they are to busy working on the FIAT 500 one-ton pickup, and the FIAT 500 Super SUV.",2015,8,7
"I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to :  How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper   
 
Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?  
 
Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991  https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/  
 
Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?",2020,11,19
"The 500e is going on sale imminently in the UK (the new version). Not sure what colour/location brake lights and indicators the US 500e has, or what fog lights/reflectors it has. The modifications to make it compliant could be costly. I can't recall if the 500e has rapid charging, but if it's CCS Type 1 you will not be able to rapid charge anywhere (we use CCS Type 2). Also while the Type 1 inlet will accept 230v, will it be happy at 50hz rather than 60? I'd hope so but not sure.",2020,11,19
"A friend purchased a Fiat Professional e-Scudo LWB van.  
 
As the Fiat Professional e-Scudo is another van from Stellantis, using the same platform as the Citroen e-Dispatch, Peugeot e-Expert, Vauxhall Vivaro-e, Toyota Proace, etc, the assumption was that it’ll essentially be the same as the others apart from the logo.  
 
So, cosmetically it does look like any of the others apart from the Fiat logo on the front grill and rear. Also feature-wise, as expected, they are all much in much the same.  
 
One exception seems to be that the Fiat e-Scudo version doesn’t have an app of any description. So you can’t check even the basic of settings remotely, or access firmware or map updates when they are released for their sibling Stellantis brands. 
 
As far as I can tell the e-Scudo does already have the necessary hardware built-in, it’s just that Fiat seem to have no intention of enabling the features or releasing an app any time soon.",2023,1,23

"I've posted this in the fiat 500 forum with more info about my problemsjuat thought I'd post this here as it may get seen more..... 
 
 
 
 
Hi there, I have a 500e icon on lease and it was all going good untill a month ago I kept getting a onscreen warning saying something is wrong with the passenger airbag and the SOS assistance. 
 
I called fiat and they said take it to my local dealer but I didn't have time as it's 16 mile away and I go to work. But then as of a couple of week ago I was sometimes getting a seatbelt warning symbol and sound and it seemed to only happen when I was turning left lol....I tried to pull on the seatbelt in different directions and where it clips in to recreate the warning but it never happene donly when I drive and turn left. 
 
And now I keep getting all those warning but no it says one pedal driving unavailable and to use the normal break...and yep in range and Sherpa when this wanting happens I take foot of accelerator and the car keeps going...no refen breaking 
 
Just drove from work tonight and I had to drive 5 mile with all these warnings going off. I stopped my car twice turned it off but still happened. 
 
I've had the car since may I think it is...end of April start of may. 
 
And to top all that off last week lifting my boot lid I heard something rolling around inside my boot door/lid...where inside the boot you have that odd plastic that's coated in material covering the boot lid/door internals it sounds like sometjings come off inside there and rolling around when I'm driving or opening the boot. 
 
I have a feeling fiat will tell me to take it to my dealer but it's under warranty but I need a car to get to work and back so it's not like I can leave my car with them longer than 4 to 5 hours as I start work at 3pm.",2022,12,2
"Take it to your local dealer and have it fixed. It's what the warranty is there for. Ask them for a loan car while it is being fixed. 
 
If you try to diagnose/fix it yourself, you risk voiding the warranty if what you do doesn't go to plan.",2022,12,3
"Hi All, 
 
I picked up my i3 from EVEZY last week and thought we could all do with a place to share experiences and answer any questions people may have about the process. 
 
First some background 
 
EVEZY are a short term electric car lease company with a unique business model. 
 
1) You rent the car month by month, no deposit and no minimum term (well a month minimum technically but you pay in advance) 
2) Rental includes insurance (£1000 excess though in fault claims) up to 1000 miles. month, tax and all maintenance costs 
3) you do not get a key, you use an app to lock and unlock the car. 
4) You can pick cars up and drop them off and ""depots"" around the country. 
 
You can use a referral code (see below   ) to get £50 off your first month. 
 
My experiences so far.  
 
I phoned on Wednesday and asked for a 120 i3. No problems at all; arranged pickup the next day from Windsor 
 
Took the train to Windsor only to realise it is a 4 mile trip to the pickup point, I stupidly decided to walk. The pickup point is not obvious and is actually someone's house (the cars are all parked in a big yard) There were at least 3 i3s and a few Zoes there as well. 
 
Once I find the car (the reg is on the app) it connect to the app via bluetooth and a button unlocks the car. The car was brand new and still had the plastic seat covers on so I was pleasantly surprised (note there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.) 
 
The only hitch was that the 3 pin cable to charge the car is in the front boot and the button on the app did not seem to work. I phoned them and it is a known problem that they are working on (hint to EVEZY, if this is an issue don't put the charging cable in the boot!) Fortunately I RTFM and found the emergency release wire in the cabin so used that to open and move the cable into the back boot. 
 
Car is great, there is a dash-cam but you soon forget about that, otherwise it is just like a normal i3. When I got home I was able to activate the BMW connected app and set preconditioning times etc so that all works like a normal car.  
 
Overall I am very impressed, the lease is cheaper than most other places and far more flexible, it also includes insurance so that is another saving. My only concern is the app but it is working fine so far. I have only had to enter the password once but do now carry my reading glasses everywhere I go! 
 
My referral code is in my sig. I know others have codes as well so feel free to contribute and people can pick a code at random! 
 
Please feel free to ask any more questions if you have them.",2019,3,5
Done 👍,2020,4,21
Also done. Thought it important you got a boomer’s point of view ,2020,4,21
"Following my suggestion, evezy have have agreed to rollover mileage until July. That way, any mileage credit you accumulate during lockdown will be rolled over. Hopefully if lockdown finishes by the end of May, we’ll have June and July to hit the open road without having to pay overage charges if we do more than 1k miles. (As long as we don’t go over that months allocation and rolled over miles from March onwards).",2020,4,21
"And those 8ppm refunds for unused miles...? 
 
... oh. 😂",2020,4,21
"Just sent off my return notice to Evezy, done 100 miles in the i3 last month, not the best use of £400. I have ordered a £290pm 15k 1+23 PCH on new Zoe GT line so a lot cheaper than evezy on all counts",2020,4,22
"Can I ask who with? 
That looks like a good deal.",2020,4,22
Great deal 👍,2020,4,22
"I returned my Evezy i3 today, so there should be a 120Ah available soon for whoever is next on the waiting list. 
 
Dropping the car off wasn’t as straightforward as I’d hoped. I got to the NCP in Bristol and tried to use the QR code provided over email.. and “Evezy FULL” is all it would say on the display. Luckily with lockdown there was no one waiting behind me at the barriers. Eventually had to get a ticket and hope that I don’t get charged for it. 
 
Anyway, that’s my Evezy journey over for now. It’s been a blast, and apart from two occasions early on where their services went down it’s been 100% solid. A great service really.",2020,4,22
"Just to clarify I can afford it just fine, it’s the principle 😂",2020,4,22
"They will try their absolute best to pretend it doesn’t. 
 
It’s a sticky wicket though. How would they handle it? 
 
It makes sense to charge the money owed from the freeze period once the customer hands the car back, but 1) they could be waiting a while and 2) a lump sum payment won’t go down well with customers. 
 
Do they increase the monthly charge after a freeze period to compensate? Possibly - but they may not ever get the money back if the customer returns the car! 
 
The only pragmatic approach, which I’ve suggested and been refused endlessly, is goodwill discounts based on unused mileage.",2020,4,25
"The intent by the government is to assist those in need and provide payment holidays for car payments so it should apply. Yes the car can be returned but may still be essential for some who are in financial difficulty and need help. 
 
The best approach as suggested is to offer discounts based on mileage for the period. Sharing the pain seems the best approach.",2020,4,26
"The payment holiday doesn't mean that the debt goes away, and the expectation is that you will still have to repay the full amount plus interest after the holiday. This applies to loan repayments. This is different to the EVEZY model where you pay for a rental service without any loan.",2020,4,26
"I think the issue is more that literally every monthly payment service in every other area is at least offering a goodwill gesture. 
 
Meanwhile, Evezy: “Something about European driving that most people don’t care about” 
 
Just doesn’t look great or inspire loyalty, y’know?",2020,4,26
"Surely the point is that the EvEzy system is designed for exactly this type of scenario - if you don't want to pay you don't have to - you just give the car back as you aren't tied in. The mortgage and PCP companies still want their money, with interest, they are just changing your profile payment and charging you extra for the privilege.",2020,4,26
"Which would be fine if they were able to supply a replacement quickly when the time comes to resubscribe, which they currently can’t do. So effectively if you want use of a car at all in the next 6 months (the time it’d take them to supply a replacement), your only real option is to keep your current car and pay for it. 
 
Hence the request for a goodwill gesture in recognition of their own supply issues. 
 
That’s all we’re asking for. A gesture to loyal customers to compensate for their current failings as a business. But currently their attitude is “lol tough shit if you don’t like it give it back”. 
 
Great, cool, good CRM guys.",2020,4,26
Evezy isn’t a finance product so the FCA guidance on car finance breaks doesn’t apply. If you want a break from payments return the car!,2020,4,26
Yawn. I tried.,2020,4,26
"I’m not quite at the point of picking up an inventory car with cash yet - as far as I’m aware, Model 3s are still a depreciating asset and I’m averse to having cash tied up in such things, but as used prices drop then stabilise I’m sure there’ll be a point where that becomes preferable or even more flexible compared to Evezy...",2020,4,26
"Aye but buying for cash means you can get rid at a moments notice, just like Evezy. Eventually there’ll be a point where the depreciation plateaus relative to the buy price and it’ll be worth doing. 
 
Previously I was hiring Model S whenever I needed a car through Enterprise Exotics, or whatever seemed interesting from the EV centre in MK, but then we moved somewhere that required more frequent car use (not necessarily more miles though) so went with Evezy for flexibility. Price wise is roughly the same per mile as the Enterprise rentals, but availability is obviously better if the car is outside your house! 
 
PCP you still have the ball ache of flogging it when no longer required, and I don’t like the “debt” showing on my credit report. I’ve never finished a PCP term - usually got rid after 3-6 months of a 4 year deal and never really lost out (sub £1k losses), but it’s just a bit of a pain to do so. 
 
Under normal circumstances, Evezy is still the best option, but it would just be nice to have my loyalty rewarded.",2020,4,26
"According to this  article  people will avoid public transport for the rest of the year and be looking to buy a new or used vehicle. Many will look to long term rental in order to remain flexible. Londoners could opt for EVs to avoid the congestion and emissions charge, and take advantage of cheap parking. Could this situation play into the hands of evezy?",2020,4,26
"@UKTechie  One Fiat 500, one Mazda MX5, one battery lease Renault Zoe and one Ioniq Hybrid. All sold during PCP after 12 months at most. 
 
 @E7EV  With respect that article is probably balls. Folk can stay at home or rent cars if they like, but I wager it’ll be a fearful minority not the majority. Most of us will be back on the tube to work first chance we get. 
 
Remember that most folk (including myself) were still commuting to work in London, on the tube, in late March as the curve was climbing and infection rates were basically exponential. Even with those high odds, I still don’t know a single friend or colleague who has reported symptoms (although being no older than early 30s probably helps!) 
 
By the time the “state” lets us outside again (almost as if we’re adults capable of evaluating risk all by ourselves), the actual danger will be far lower than it was in late March. 
 
The perception may well be different given all the fear mongering press, but most folk will see through it, look at the numbers, cover their face just to be sure and get on a train to work. 
 
Of course if it starts climbing again we’ll all re-evaluate, but probably choose “staying home” over “driving to work”.",2020,4,26

"They'll all be ordering electric bikes, and joking aside bike shops have seen a tremendous surge in sales! I don't need a bike for commuting but ordered one last week, though as a new launch not exactly sure when it will arrive (shades of ordering a new car). Off up to the allotment very shortly on my old one. 
 
It's easy to forget on a car site just how many households don't have a car. My nephew and niece didn't for years as they lived in exactly those circumstances.",2020,4,27
"Same. Was happily car-less for just over two years until recently. And even then it’s been a patchy mix of rentals, disposable PCPs and Evezy",2020,4,27
"End of the term? What’s that? I’ve never had a PCP longer than a year, I get bored too quickly 😂",2020,4,27
"Ha ha, ive seen mine to end of term but then the only 2 i had were 3months and 6months

Just a quick note to say that I am very pleased with my i3 and Evezy. I had a few issues with windows and doors not closing/locking, so they just came and swapped the car this morning. Everything went smoothly and the car was both cleaned and fully charged   
 
I was worried about getting hit with some fines or the app not reconnecting but they were absolutely fine in both cases. I need not have worried. Even reconnected the BMW app without any delay or fuss. 
 
They will wipe the data from the system as part of their 'refurb' (or what ever it's called when a car goes back to them).

"It's really sad to see Nissan in such a state. I'd say right up until the first LEAF, they were a distinctly Japanese manufacturer leading the way in a lot of fields. I'm not even talking about the old Silvias and ""iconic"" JDM stuff - the GT-R and 370Z weren't that long ago, for example..! Since then, the Japanese-designed stuff seems to have been half-arsed (eg LEAF 2) and the rest is just ""too many cooks"" Eurotrash (Qashqai etc). 
 
I'd love to buy a Nissan circa 1980-2010. It was a mark of quality. No more, though... whether that's the fault of Ghosn or the xenophobes who ousted him that have now taken the reins, I'm not sure.",2020,5,5
"Today's random Evezy bug: 
 
My mileage allowance for this month has shown as 1000 throughout, until I preconditioned the car remotely to charge the 12v, then it showed 999. I suspect the reason for this is GPS error tolerance - I reckon the car reported a slightly different GPS position when it switched on to precondition than it had when it was parked, and the black box therefore thought the car had moved. Perhaps only by 0.05 miles or something, but the Evezy app rounds down anyway so this was enough to cause it to display 999. 
 
They're looking into it anyway. Personally if I was them I'd increase the GPS tolerance to not count movement below 0.5mi or something.

Seen an article and that first editions will be nearly £30k in the U.K. This is a silly price for what is just a city runabout. Why did they not go for a smaller battery and a more basic trim and get the price below £20k. At this rate EVs will continue to be out of reach for most people on average incomes.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice. I collect my Fiat 500e this weekend, it comes with a free wall charger (The EasyWallBox be Engie). However I am struggling to get anyone to Install it. 
 
It can be plugged into a standard mains outlet for 2.3KW, or installed properly for 7KW. It has a DPM sensor for monitoring the load on the main fuse. 
 
Ive got a call with Western Power (I am in South Wales) to takes us off a loop and upgrade our fuse to 80A (From 63A), and so far I have had two installers say they cannot help as they are not 'accredited' for that charger. I contacted Fiat and they said to contact Engie, Engie said they do not keep a list of installer and instead just sent me the Installation manual for installers. All the other installers ive contacted have either not responded to their ""contact me"" form, or don't answer the phone 
 
Has anyone had any luck getting this charger installed? 
 
I appreciate that most people would just get a podpoint or something installed instead of the Fiat one if they had to buy one.",2021,7,27
I don't understand why an installer would think they need to be accredited for a particular charger. I know there is huge demand at the moment so maybe they're just too busy to bother with something unfamiliar.,2021,7,28
"As  @mikeselectricstuff  stuff said, there is no legal requirement for accreditation, over and above being a competent electrician and (for England and Wales) being a member of one of the Part P cartels. Any electrician could easily install any charge point, it's not more complex than wiring a hot tub. Day's work at the most, often they only take half a day if the installation is straightforward. Only slight complication is registering the grant application, but that really isn't that difficult or time consuming.",2021,7,28
"Yeah, I was a bit confused about it. Ive not even been able to get a quote from anyone yet. Despite contacting 8 electricians that indicate they install EV chargers. I guess it must be down to their business as you say.",2021,7,28
"To add, this isnt the case with every manufacturer...",2021,7,29
"EO are likely to find themselves in hot water with that clause. This wouldn't be the first time that a manufacturer has tried to create a closed shop like this. A heat pump manufacturer (more accurately a UK distributor) tried the same trick with me years ago, and tried to make out that the product only had a warranty if installed by one of their accredited installers. As I'd bought the thing from a wholesaler, had all the competences and qualifications needed to install it, and had no intention of spending as much as I'd paid for it to get a (pretty pointless for me) chit just to do one installation, I challenged them. Have to say they didn't even argue about it when challenged. I offered to send them photos, but they just backed right off and made it clear that they legally had to honour the warranty as long as the unit was installed as per their MIs. 
 
If anyone gets this sort of challenge from any charge point supplier/manufacturer then I think they need to challenge it. The one proviso is that manufacturers can choose to offer an extended warranty, over and above any statutory warranty, that may be dependent on certain conditions being met. Even then I believe that the onus would be on them to prove that the installation was in some way non-compliant with their MIs, and that the failure was a consequence of shortcomings in the installation. That's probably a pretty tough thing for them to prove, especially if the installer has taken photos at the time (I do this all the time now, as much to assist my memory as anything else). 
 
As an aside, the tendency by manufacturers to try and create closed shops is something that seems to be getting more common. I'm pleased to see that the ""Right to Repair"" movement seems to be countering this to some extent. When my Macbook needs replacing it won't be with another one, that's for sure, it will most probably be this ""designed to be repaired/upgraded"" laptop:  Framework Laptop pre-orders are now open  , primarily because I do not like the way Apple are trying very hard to stop anyone other than their own stores fixing their stuff.",2021,7,29
"Again, back to mikes original query with regards to why installers feel they have to gain the accreditation... 
 
Installers arent going to want to argue t&cs with the manufacturer, regardless of law, easier just to get accredited accordingly... 
 
With regards to doing the accreditation, it all depends on how busy that installer is... they will just say no to spending a few hours sending certs off and doing additional online courses (or whatever the manufacturer requires them to do) if they are too busy. 
 
Yes i was going to refference apple dont/didnt they have anti tamper sensors so only genius bar etc could open them up?",2021,7,29

"Hi All, 
 
New here, but thought I would share my experience so far of buying a used Leaf. 
 
My wife had a Fiat 500, which was becoming far too small for her and our 2 year old son, she asked if we could change it to something bigger, my immediate thought was a Leaf, I have wanted one since they were announced in the UK, however the cost of them have been quite prohibitive, but thought as there are a few used ones available, now is the time to look, so that resulted in a trip to my local Nissan dealer to see what they had in stock. 
 
I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out (note the 'I') however my wife wasn't interested in the slightest, she wanted a Corsa (huge in comparison to the 500 Convertible) so, we got her one. I then decided I wanted one so much I sold my 2 year old Zafira Tourer to get one. While this was happening the dealer sold the one I was looking at, so by the time I was ready for one two weeks later, they did a group stock search and found me one that matched my criteria exactly - Max of upto 3 years old, White, and maximum of 15k on the clock, it had done 12,000 miles. It was however at another location within the group so I put a deposit down on the 28th of Feb to get the car over to me. That process took 10 days to move the car 40 miles, which surprised me to be honest as if I thought it was actually going to take that long I would have gone to the garage it was at and looked at it there, but they did say it could take that long. 
 
As soon as the car arrived I was like a kid the night before Christmas, so excited. I shot down to the dealer to take it out for a drive. When I got there the car's bodywork was spotless, which made me very happy, however, the dealer pointed out before getting into the car it was missing it's SD Card, now as I have spent some time lurking in the background here, I know it's more than just maps stored on there and how useless the Centre Console is without it. But they promised me they could get me one in within 10 Days, so thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt and trust them. There was another issue with the steering wheel, as in it would rattle over small bumps, but they said that would be fixed. 
 
Well, lets say it will be 3 weeks on Friday since this was pointed out, I am still waiting, I resorted to contacting Nissan UK's MD office to find out what the hell is going on, the part has a 6 week lead time, not 10 days as the dealer was quoting (they were told 10 days by Nissan) So I am still without a car that I can use the basic functions on such as set the clock, listen to the radio, set charge schedules etc. 
 
There is still no sign of the card, and no time frame as to when to expect it, the steering problem has returned, the drivers seat has developed a nasty squeak on the backrest. All of the rattles and squeaks are only made worse as I cant drown them out with the radio! 
 
Nissan have agreed to lend me a demo car until the dealer can come to a resolution to the matter, the last time I heard from them was Friday, I have told them I want an exchange vehicle under the Nissan Cared for promise. 
 
I am sick of the fact that no one is giving me a date for anything! I have had a car that hasn't had any of it's advertised features for over 2 weeks now, which is not acceptable, especially as it was promised within 10 days, and that was part of the conditions of sale, I said to the salesman I would wait if he could say it would be within 10 days.  
 
My plan now is to return the car as I am not happy with it, I am not happy with the service I have had, and it sure as hell isn't as advertised. 
 
Lesson of the story is STAY WELL CLEAR of Leaf's that are missing the SD Cards.",2017,3,29

Does anyones GTE experience a slight juddering when in electric mode? This happens to mine when sat in traffic and slowly pulling away the car judders. I have it booked in to be looked at by VW in a couple of weeks but wasn't sure if this was normal.,2015,10,14
"Drat. It seems I've joined the club... 
 
Few days ago I started to feel a judder when at low speeds/pulling away. Only noticed it when on electric, it kind of feels like trying to pull away in an ICE in too high a gear, although the display says it's in 1st. This happens whether I'm using ACC or manually accelerating. Like others, it goes away above around 5 mph. I'll give it a couple of weeks to see whether it's temporary, otherwise it'll be a trip to the dealer :-(.  
 
This is my first time with an automatic gearbox, but I've also noticed sluggishness in a few situations. For example with a typical manual ICE, I could stick it in reverse to pull out of a parking space, bung it in 1st when still rolling backwards, and away we go forwards. In the GTE I've nearly crashed while attempting similar manoeuvres. While gently rolling backwards in reverse I moved the stick to D and hit the go pedal - nothing happens. I probably went another 4-5 feet backwards before the car finally got the message. This also happens if gently moving forwards, putting it in reverse & hitting Go. There's a noticeable lag in response. Anyone else experienced this? Wondering if it could be connected to an issue with the gearbox, or whether it's my inexperience of an automatic! 
 
Cheers",2018,7,6
"Thankfully I don't have the dreaded judder. However this is my first automatic too and it has been my lifelong habit to select first gear while rolling backwards and use the clutch to stop the car and drive off forwards in one slick movement. 
 
I have given that up. It dawned on me that the maneuver depended heavily on clutch control and you have lost that in an automatic. It feels like mechanical abuse now so I stopped doing it.",2018,7,6
"Yep, I know what you mean! Old habits die hard... 
 
On the way home I had some stop start traffic including juddering so thought I'd do a test. Put the car in battery charge mode to fire up the ICE & the judder got noticeably worse & lasted up until about 7mph. Electric only it lasted until around 4mph. 
 
Going on a long drive tomorrow, if still doing it after a good run I reckon it's dealer time. Yay .",2018,7,6
"@D1708  Sorry off topic, but do you have the tyre maintenance package and that's why you have to go to ATS? I took tyres off my service/main plan because of the ATS-only option (12 mile round trip to the nearest one for me and I don't live in the sticks).",2018,7,11
"I too joined this club. Got my GTE Advance mid May and within 4 weeks had started juddering. Spent a while myself trying to find the cause and was pointed by a friend to this forum. 
I booked my car in last week and took these forum posts in, the “Service Assistant” pushed them back across the table to me without looking at them. 
Initially they couldn’t make it go wrong and asked me how I managed it - I suggested they read these posts. 
They eventually made it happen and have ordered a new Mechatronics unit which should be fitted tomorrow - won’t be happy if this re-occurs!",2018,7,18
"I just got the following response from my VW dealer after they have had my car a month to replace the Mechatronics unit which didn't fix the fault and going back to VW for advice. 
""VW Say it's a characteristic of the vehicle"" 
My dealer isn't happy with that response - neither am I. They are not happy as VW's initial response was to replace the Mechatronics unit and it shouldn't have been if at that point it was expected behavior. Also, older GTE's don't do it, and if it was expected behavior then surely it would have done it in the first couple of weeks of ownership, not just starting at week 3 ? 
My case continues...",2018,8,7
"Yep, your dealer and yourself are right to be calling cobblers.  
 
Keep pushing! 
 
I know it’s of no help at all, but my 2015 model GTE has felt unburstable and it has never ever juddered.  
 
You’d hope that any franchised VW dealer know what they’re doing, but a previous car I had (a Polo GTI with DSG box) went in for a judder in first and second gear at low speeds.  
 
They diagnosed a faulty clutch pack, which was duly replaced but the DSG box was playing up even worse on the test drive.  
 
The DSG box had to be re-calibrated using a software procedure that nobody in the dealership had done before, it took them a few days to finally get it right.",2018,8,7
"What about this for an idea, use this excellent forum to prove them wrong !!!. 
Ask the members to conduct a pole to see how many GTE owners have the judder in there cars. 
Just age and mileage of the car and if they have EVER suffered from this type of problem. 
Then tell VW what they already know ............. very limited number only DO suffer from this problem. 
I will start the ball rolling :- 
July 2015 model, covered just over 21,000 miles NO JUDDER PRESENT IN ANY DRIVE MODE !. 
I am an X-Tech myself, so if my car had any type of judder when taking up the drive - I think I would know !. 
I hate being ""fobbed off"" when the car has a genuine fault.",2018,8,7

"So VW have recommended a replacement DSG. Courtesy car went back to the dealer today and Mobex dropped off a Golf R. I told them I wanted something economical and preferably a diesel, that obviously didn't get translated right to them.",2018,12,1
Inchcape lent me a Tiguan diesel with DSG for 3 days and even that was thirsty with it being a 4 wheel drive car. I'm expecting the R to be filled up weekly to be honest. It's a hoot to drive no doubt but sadly it's also a massive target for people to Rob or race on the road. I'll definitely ask about the cost of a dsg replacement.,2018,12,1
"For short to medium distance trips, most models are going to feel ""thirsty"" after the GTE !. 
My wife has a new basic Fiat 500 that is fine for what she requires, but it is SO under powered it is crazy !. 
But truly, I do feel we are visiting the petrol station MORE often for her car than my GTE !. 
The last time the GTE was in for service, the dealer gave me a 1.0 Litre three cylinder Polo to use for the day. 
Granted, you could buy 3 Polo's for what the GTE costs new, but after driving that car for even 1 day - I was SO glad to get my GTE back !. Honestly, it did feel like it consumed MORE petrol in that one day than my GTE would have done so over the same driven distance. Okay, I know this is because my car would have been running a lot of that time on electric power, but you do quickly become use to this method of propulsion and therefore DO spend less time visiting the petrol stations as a result !. 
I STILL think the the GTE is a pretty hard act to follow, given it has been out now for WELL over three years !. 
Strange situation really, the GTE was something that really took it's time getting started and in turn liked by the early buyers. The feed back from the motoring press was pretty positive, but the take up of the GTE was slow, but after it had been released just after a year, very quickly the demand for the car went stupid CRAZY !. 
The massive and sudden increase in it's demand, I think was part of it's demise in the end ????. 
Normal, I would have replaced my GTE at three years - but prior to reaching the car's 3rd birthday, there was nothing out there that could offer me anything more than my car had to offer at that present moment in time I.M.H.O. 
This is why I still have my car now when it is WELL over three years old ( that is a real first for me ). 
The problem I see with owning a GTE myself is simply this, returning to a full on only fossil car is NOT an option really anymore. So I guess to this level then the GTE has done a really great job, a brilliant ( toe in the water / introduction ) into the world of electric propulsion, also with the addition of a fossil fuel back up should you need it for them longer trips. 
For me anyway, a full B.E.V. has to be the next step really - but right now I feel that I am sitting in a waiting room, being caught out between the now decreasing amount of hybrid cars available and the small choice of affordable BEV's that has a range to suit my needs. 
Okay, the new Kona has just been recently been released at a price that is NOT stupid / crazy and does indeed have a very good electrical mileage range between each charge. 
Getting your hands on a 64 KW Kona is a totally different ball game I believe !!!. 
They ARE in front of other manufacture's right now with regards to bringing an E.V. to the market that is both affordable to the majority of the people, BUT can also cover a real world reasonable distance on a single charge. 
For this alone, they should be very welcomed and commended for doing so. 
The wait list is very long for the Kona I understand, but there IS more models from other manufacture's to follow in 2019 - 2020. 
It's a really strange feeling right now, I just feel like the new nervous prospective father sitting outside of the labour ward in a hospital !. 
You know something great is going to happen very soon, but the waiting is killing you and are not sure when and what the new delivery is likely to be !!!!. Ha Ha !.",2018,12,1
"agree with all of above luklily my GTE is only a year old so will be up for replacement just as the ID comes out. As for amount of fuel, we also have a 1.2 Fiat 500, it gets about 40mpg worse than driving the GTE hard in ICE only, mind you the tank is about half the size and drops from 1/4 full to empty in just a few miles so we are always filling the Fiat tank up which makes it feel worse. Had a new GTI last week for a few hours and only got 28mpg.",2018,12,2
"So, my Mk 7.5 from Oct. 2017 had the Mechatronic unit replaced twice, last in Sep 2018, and the jutter returned on Dec 28th. The dealer then tried to change the oil from one type to another, but that didn't help at all. Still juttering. 
So now the car is going back to the garage next Thursday. Unless they decide to replace the entire gear box I think I will have to return the car and get my money back, unfortunately. 
But I guess replacing the entire gearbox won't eliminate the problem either...",2019,1,16

"One year on from my Mechatronics & Gearbox replacement and the juddering has not returned. It does appear the dealer didn’t tighten the exhaust back up properly during the works as I had to take it back for that but the original fault is gone.

"The PSA Peugeot / Citroen forum is incorrectly titled and poorly organised. 
 
With your help, we'd like to fix that. 
 
Stellantis brands are Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, RAM, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. 
 
Stellantis are rapidly becoming a major BEV manufacturer. Fiat will be an EV only brand in Europe by 2026. That is full BEVs, not hybrids. 
 
 
 
I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum. That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out.

Fixed.,2022,3,21
"Group cars and vans on the same body together would be the most sensible I think. Otherwise I'd think it would get out of hand very quickly. 
 
It also highlights common vehicles with common underpinnings which quite often have the same issues. Much easier to see at a glance when a new herd of 'why does my X do this' where X is the same actual car but with a different jacket on.",2022,3,21
"Yep, group by floor pan. 
 
Bear in mind the unintended consequences of that logic; you should also regroup VAG products, and likewise HKMC. 
 
(I always thought we should, really...) 
 
It makes perfect sense because both hardware and software are common features/faults, and if the forum is aiming to be a relevant technical resource, then failing to group Audi with Skoda (say) is just badge discrimination of no meaningful benefit.",2022,3,21
"Clearly no effort has been made to group other sibling manufacturers cars together so picking on stellantis is wrong for more reasons than one might think. 
Treat these vehicles the same as everything else. 
From the perspective of what I drive this would mean having a Vauxhall forum with sub forums for Mokka and another for Corsa etc. 
Vans should be treated however they already are. 
Similar for Peugeot and Citroën 
The stellantis name shouldn't even come into it. 
 
Clearly if someone has an issue with a pug 208 and the issue might also relate to a corsa they can search appropriately. 
 
By grouping things together it makes things a lot less clear and more difficult and for no reasonable benefit. 
 
Another example is where posts that should have gone straight into the mokka forum were in random places because the poster could not locate the correct place. 
 
The issue is the amount of work to do initially but once organised correctly the only extra work to do is add a new sub forum for a new car. 
 
Of course, you might want to group opel with vauxhall but that is clearly sensible.

Once the Stellantis forum is organised there is no reason not to group others similarly either. It's all been a mess for a long time.,2022,3,21

I fall into the engineer group that drives the car, and couldn't care less about the badge.  
 
Before the internet, I would take things apart, including my brand new cars just to see how they were put together. Now I can google it and let someone else take the risk. 
 
The Munro live videos are influencing my upcoming car decision. I've already removed one car from the long list because I don't like the engineering decisions.",2022,3,21
Which is why I posted this survey instead of just asking the admin team to make the change.,2022,3,21
"I think grouping cars by body makes sense on a forum more devoted to DIY repairs, in depth technical analysis and stuff like that. It will likely make more sense when the cars are older as well. 
 
I think this forum, these days is more about the consumer side where people will take their cars to garages, often dealers and so it is more appropriate for the cars to be grouped by make and model.  
 
Just because the e-208 and Corsa e share fundamental components, that doesn't matter for customers discussing dealers, discounts and the like nor does it have much to do with servicing and maintenance when they are so new. Having all Vauxhall and Peugeot posts in one forum muddies those discussions considerably.  
 
I originally voted for group cars and vans by body because that makes sense to me as a nerd/more technical person but I have changed to car and vans get separate sub-forums based on responses to this thread and considering the purpose of this forum overall. Also, one big benefit of computers, we can have as many sub-fora as we want! 
 
It's interesting to consider the long term implications for this forum really, when all new cars are EVs this could be a busy place, but I guess people will split off as all the dedicated manufacturer forums will have sub-forums for the EVs. SpeakEV can remain as a manufacturer agnostic place for general discussion of EV motoring in the UK (mostly).",2022,3,21
"I'm waiting on delivery of an E208 so I've used this forum quite extensively. My own interest in engineering and cars in particular mean I've gone into the Corsa section to see if the same questions are asked. I have never driven a Corsa so although I know the car and technology are the same I'm not aware how different the driving experience might be. Does the Corsa come with all the same dashboard, interior functions and options as a 208 or is the experience of buying and riving the car quite different (and I don't mean from a performance or handling perspective). 
 
If the purchasing options, driving performance (perspective?) and choice to me as a buyer are not the same then they should not share a thread. 
 
If, however this forum is for the real technical differences on how they are built, how they drive, range, 0-60 then they perhaps should share a forum. However, most questions I see on here tend to be about the experience of buying and driving the car in which case Stellantis want us to think they are different (nowhere on the Peugeot website does it tell me it's the same platform as the Vauxhall , Citroen, Fiat etc) then perhaps we should differentiate?",2022,3,21
"It’s also worth noting that while the platforms are similar a lot of the insides are different. A Corsa-E for example has a completely different dashboard system to the e208 or a e-c4. The Corsa-e also has, I believe, multiple settings on the stalks for things like the intermittent wiper function where Peugeots and Citroens are speed sensitive and adjust automatically. Intellilux lights are different to the Matrix LEDs used across the group. These are just day to day examples but they illustrate the point.  
 
I originally voted for ‘by body’ - but I think perhaps from a consumers perspective what sits underneath is an irrelevance. When you are needing help you want to understand and get guidance on what you touch and feel. 
 
Maybe ‘marque’ grouping would be a suitable way with sub Fora for models if deemed necessary.",2022,3,21
"All of the cars except for the Fiat 500 are on the same platform.  
 
The e208 and Corsa-e share the same body. 
 
The e-C4, e2008, Mokka-e and DS 3 eTense share the same body. 
 
 
The interior styling is different. There is overlap but they look different. The options are bundled differently. For example, the e-2008 has a better base sound system than the Citroen. However the Citroen has an optional upgrade while the Peugeot does not. 
 
There are more similarities than differences, but they are not the same. 
 
 
The real question is how best to organise and answer questions? People who ONLY want to know if there is an audio upgrade for the e-2008 are going to be best served by a dedicated e-2008 forum. Someone who is cross shopping will want to know about the sound system in all 4 of them. Do you ask the same question 4 times in each sub-forum?

Stellantis are rapidly becoming a major BEV manufacturer. Fiat will be an EV only brand in Europe by 2026. That is full BEVs, not hybrids. 
 
 
 
I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum.  That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out.

"This is a consumer led forum - not an engineering one. How many Vauxhall / Citroen / Fiat drivers are even aware of the corporate governance of the owning company? Why should they care? In my view - most people will be looking for the brand and car - and that's how it should be organised. It would be useful to then have a pinned discussion or information note ""that the following cars are similar and you may find useful information here too"".",2022,3,21
"Maybe a 'sticky' somewhere that new entrants arrive at, then, which list all the vehicles that have their own sub-forum and where to find that. (And, indirectly, also showing which models are NOT given a specific forum)

Doing nothing is the worst option. I've come up with a compromise that doesn't make too much work for  @Admin  and me while fixing the worst of the problems.  
 
 
I've asked  @Admin  to  
 
1) Change PSA To Stellantis. PSA no longer exist.

For discussing Peugeot and branded EVs and PHEVs 
 
 
New Top level Name: 
 
Stellantis: Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat, Vauxhall and Opel 
 
2) Split the Corsa-E and Mokka-E into two sub-forums. 
 
Rename the current one to Corsa-E. Make a new Mokka-E sub-forum. I'll move posts as needed. 
 
3) Create a new Citroën Ami sub-forum in the Stellantis area.",2022,3,23
"A compromise as you say but it does follow the path of having the least amount of work for the admin people so they'll be pleased. 
It still leaves a bit of work to round up all the Vx Pug etc post which went into the general ev section and maybe elsewhere but truly the number of posts are so few it probably doesn't matter. 
The feeling is people looked for Vx etc, didn't find it and moved on rather than posting in the general group. 
After the update people will easily spot what they need to particularly if they realise nothing is in alphabetical order and will look much further down to find Citroën.

"Fair play to them for going through the exercise to import it and getting it registered. I wonder how much was paid for it after all the taxes, shipping and fees. No Rapid Charging, so a 24kWh battery is going to make it short range commuter or shopping trolley. What about maintenance or repairs given it's a US spec. If it stops working during someone's weekly commute, what is going to be the timeframe to get a repair quoted for, nevermind fixed. Will insurance be limited to specialists, given the modifications/import status. 
 
In the same way that i3s is thinking, it will appeal to a car fan who wants to own something unusual. I wonder if it will back back on the market in 12 months.

"So last weekend was the first time I’ve used the rapid charge network in 5 years !!! And I can honestly say it’s as hard if not harder to get anywhere now even though I was using a 24kwh env200 and now I’m on 40kwh one . 
Facts- 
More charge points ( more reliable?? ) 
More Evs  
Scores more dumb uneducated drivers  
Arrived to find both rapids occupied both by drivers charging to 100% and wouldn’t move even though I explained kindly the etiquette. And another 2 the other day that arrived having no idea how to use the chargers and I had to wait for them to install and app , sort account out and basically f about . . Can only think this going to get worse . Now I do t believe people are being ignorant I just think the manufacturers are so keen to throw Evs out and not educating people.",2022,11,3
"The only way you can fix the 100% issue is at the network side. The charger could for instance simply stop once rates dip below a defined point. 
 
Its also much more nuanced than it once was... An older small battery car like a LEAF might struggle to get above 40kw at any point in its charge cycle, and will be tapering from 80% or even before if the battery is hot. An e-tron (or some other large battery car) might on the other hand pull 50kw all the way to 95%.",2022,11,3
They have the right to sit plugged to the very last dregs of available electrons. But when they use that to dogmatically claim that right is where it becomes debatable. If the futility of wasting half an hour of their lives to load an extra two miles of range is explained - and then ignored - then a different form of mindset is at work. People like that are out there.,2022,11,3
"Etiquette is for polite people but asking someone if they could move on would probably be met by resistance from a majority of people who have not been part of this group and even some that are  
Perhaps signs should be in place asking people to only charge above 85% if strictly necessary for their onward journey and to move to a slower chargerpoint if available. 
Of course, there's always going to be those who insist they need 100%  
One way to deal with things would be to make pricing increase from start to finish of the session. 
First 5 kW free next 5 at 10p then the next at an increasing rate which would encourage folk to move to a new session on slower equipment to get their 100% 
Sure you'd get people moving around all the time to minimise cost but it would free things up for others to start charging. 
Heavy fines for anyone just stretching leads.

"Yesterday used an Osprey set of 3 fast chargers. A fiat 500 parked in end spot so I parked in middle to find that middle charger was being used by the fiat 500 and so had effectively blocked 1/3rd of the chargers.  
 
I had to move and luckily the 1st spot was free and working. A couple of weeks ago it was not so I would have been stuck.  
 
I don't know why they choose the middle charger the end one was working and cable would have easily reached.  
 
I guess education will help eventually.  
 
Mind you I broke etiquette as my appointment overran and I effectively blocked a spot as the car had stopped charging. I don't think it effected anyone as when I got back the fiat had gone and there were two spots available.  
 
I think we can all be dicks at times, sometimes unintentionally.  
 
BTW not every EV user will read such forums as this to understand etiquette.  
 
As an aside I had to go to my local hospital to pick up some medication for my other half. Lots of signage to keep left along long corridors. Lot's of folk who either can't read or don't care, so you can't get folk to do simple things even with nudging. So I don't expect it to get better as more folk get EVs",2022,11,3
"As a petrol or diesel driver I used to brim the tank when filling up, it follows on that the same habit would continue when fuelling up an EV for some drivers. I would imagine the mobile phone habit of always charging to 100% is also at work here. Some people including me are guilty of not reading the manual so are somewhat ignorant of the small print. Took me a few months of research and realisation when I first got an EV before realising its better to move on at 80% than to waste another hour waiting for that satisfying 100% to appear.",2022,11,3
"If people wish to charge to 100% that's their business - I don't have a home charger at the moment, when I use a rapid I will charge to 100% as it saves me from having to go back as often, I usually do this in the daytime and sit and work in the car. 
 
Networks which require apps, dedicated accounts, with pre-loaded credit, are a pain - this is why I use Bonnet as I don't need to care what might be needed to authenticate myself and pay. 
 
I don't believe it is the manufacturer's responsibility to educate - there are so many permutations of networks and how each of them work, I believe that the owner/driver should make sure they understand this most basic part of running an EV.",2022,11,3
I think a bigger problem I have found is people plugging in when they don't really need to. Met many people at chargers plugging in just so they can park close or just because the charger is unoccupied. They don't need the range to get where they are going. Then someone who is empty is forced to wait unnecessarily. With limited charge points if people can not charge when not required it will help all people get more chance of getting a charge when needed. I've seen a lot of people suggest to always be charging eg. Plug in whenever you can which I feel gives the wrong use case on rapids. On a destination charger sure,2022,11,3
i very much doubt someones plugging in unneccesarily on a charger these days when its costing about £37 per KWh,2022,11,3
"Paying by kWh, a unit that no longer increases proportionally to the amount of time taken using the hardware may be part of the reason why the person waiting is more impatient than the person on the charger.  
 
As I've mentioned many times, a time element need to be introduced on rapid chargers. Lessons are most effective when it costs money.  
 
 
How would that work? I'm not sure, I originally thought a flat per-minute rate would be good. But it is unfair to cars that are rapid-gating, not fault of the owner. Perhaps a per-minute sur-charge that gets introduced when charge rate drops below a certain point, let's say 10% of rapid charger capacity? (Eg. below 5 kW for a 50 kW unit, below 15 kW for a 150 kW unit)  
Just throwing ideas out there, open to suggestions.  
 
 
But root of the problem is lack of rapid charger stalls at each location. I quite like Supercharger V2 and Kempower's way of splitting available power to multiple stalls. This enables more cars plugged in and at very least starting a charge.  
More cars = more chargers at each location are required. It's really simple.",2022,11,3

"Hello everyone. 
 
I test drove Opel Corsa-e (registered in 2020 November) and I loved it! I currently have fiat 500, with 13.5s to 100... Corsa was on another level, heaps above that. And I loved how it hugged the road... I was a bit shocked by how fast the range was dropping, driving it in sports through some bends and ups and downs... and a few km at 150 and 130 on the motorway... but okay, it is what it is... and I was researching charging stations after I came home, and it's not that bad to charge it... and 95% of the time we will charge it at home. the lack of battery % is the dumbest thing ever though, and I've now read that the range estimates are wonky at best 
 
now for the main issue... infotainment/main screen was VERY lackluster. There is a phone, nav, photos/SMS, music, and very few car settings, like auto-dimming the lights, auto-locking, etc... 
I and wifey were trying to get some battery management stuff to come up, but we could only get some basic version of it on the driver's screen. 
we went into the handbook, and there was mention of ""eflow"" button, etc... but our car simply didn't have that. Our car seems to have a smaller screen and no buttons to the left and right of the volume knob. 
 
I then went searching for reviews online and they all have those buttons... so what the f. is up with that?

The smaller screen is on the lower spec car, with the bigger screen on the Elite Nav. The bigger screen doesn't use up all of the screen though - huge black bars down the sides. Not sure you'd be missing much.",2022,2,3
"I don't really care that the screen is smaller... Or that it is clunky. The problem is that it is straight up missing all electric car features. Looking at consumption, statistics, preheating the car, setting of charging delay. 
 
Those last two things can only be done via the app. And what happens in 5 years when app becomes paid or stops working?  
Good luck selling the car then :/ 
 
infotainment is literally from ICE version. 
The only electric views are in drivers screen, but you can't setup anything there. And gosh did it bother me the lack of battery %",2022,2,4

Converting an older car means that you will have to spend considerably on restoring the shell and accepting a lot of old trim and ancillaries that are past their prime. It will never be ""safe"" in comparison to a newer car, and even less so once converted. If some 3rd party rights off your ""classic"" then replacement would be challenging, with a standard car it'll likely be freely available on the open market at approximately the insurance value.

"A company called ZeroEV are local to me and do this kind of conversion, you can find them on You tube. I met the owner at fully charged live we had a good conversation on the economics of conversions vs buying a purpose made EV.

"Converting an ICE is probably not the way to go if you just want a 2nd car, there are many LEAF with poor battery health which would make ideal candidates for a battery swap to non original battery type.

To what end? Buying a newer LEAF is better value.,2022,4,7
"Secondary markets always emerge. It will for sure. I don't think that is in doubt. Whether it be non branded printer cartridges or a whole sub industry of after market products or services. But it seems now is not that time unless you have deep pockets.  
 
I'd still be interested give the dice a roll. But at a price point lower than those listed by Zero-EV. I think the £20k price point mentioned by cah197 is probably more realistic. 
 
And yet we have TV programs dedicated to doing just that, retro fitting cars from ICE to EV. And these folks do not seem short of business. But they tend towards the mid to top of market it appears. 
 
The Transition-One approach is maybe the baby slopes of that market. If you search ebay there are plenty of Tesla and Leaf products starting to be listed and sold. And I think there is an article of Fully Charged about replacing or upgrading a Leaf battery to improve range. Not quite the same thing but it will come.

"My family are looking to go fully electric by replacing a Yaris with a small EV to complement our Tesla Model S. We've tried the Fiat 500 E and Mini Electric but the current favourite is a 2021 Zoe. 
 
We've been over to the local Renault dealer who have a few low mileage 2021's for sale. So far we've had a quick spin in one of them to check the driveablility, boot space, seating setup etc. but we're going back for another test drive with a reserved car this weekend. 
 
We've had the Tesla since new (6 years) so familiar with the EV experience & have home charging. Living north of the border we're also familiar with finding/using public rapids & have a ChargePlace Scotland card so that side of things should be covered. I'd be interested in any tips/things to look for on a nearly new car, e.g. checking software is up-to-date, battery health (unlikely to be an issue on a newish car?), included accessories (do Renault typically provide a granny charger or Type 2 cable?). 
 
We've had a look at a couple of YouTube reviews so are aware of the lack of side impact airbags but other than that the Zoe looks like an excellent value-for-money proposition. I've also seen this really helpful thread (apologies, there's probably a neater way to link to it!): 
 
",2022,5,12
"I've heard it's not good for the battery if the car has been left at very low state of charge for months, so I'd ask a question about that, I think half charged is ok, but not empty and not fully charged either. Probably not a biggy for such a new car, others on here might have experience of this. I bought a year old Leaf in 2013, and I think it had been left uncharged. Only 2000 miles on it. At 5 years old and having put 55k on it it had lost one fewer bars than required for a new battery and only had 55 miles useable range left.",2022,5,12
"My wife swapped her Yaris Hybrid for a new Zoe R135 GT Line just over a year ago. She's extremely happy with it, been faultless (so far) and is a much more refined car inside that the Yaris (lower road and wind noise, better seats, higher driving position). Only very slight niggle would be the rear door handles aren't as easy to use as they could be. Other than that it's a great little car, that seems to be remarkably efficient, too.",2022,5,12
"I test drove one of these last month. It's the perfect size for us and the extra range over things like the Corsa-e, Fiat 500e, etc. is very appealing. The only major obstacle is the fact that our local Renault dealer (where I test drove the car) is a complete arseclown. He made no bones about how much he dislikes EVs and how he thinks it's outrageous that we're all being forced into them. After the test drive, his monologue about how much better things used to be proved so tiresome that I got up and walked out after a few minutes of it. Unfortunately, it's a very small dealership so I'd end up having to deal with him whenever the car needed attention. 
 
Sorry, I digress. My advice would be to find out what the service manager/department's like. 😄",2022,5,12
"I guess it's worth checking that the supplied cable is genuine (or at least 3-phase like the genuine one). The car won't charge at 22kW on 22kW AC chargers if you use a single-phase cable. I don't know how you'd know though (and I'm not aware of anyone on here reporting being stitched up on the cable front, so it's probably unlikely).  
 
Also, CCS was optional on the GT Line, so if you want that, you need to ensure that the vehicle is an ""R135 GT Line Rapid Charge"" to give it its full title. 
 
Given that you're looking at such new cars, I can't really think of anything beyond what's in the thread that you linked to. As I said in the linked post, my 2016 Zoe has been a fantastic car, which is why I'm looking to ""stick with what I know"".",2022,5,12
"Easy to check if it has CCS, and so is really a rapid charge model. Open the charge port and there should be two dust covers underneath it. The upper one pulls away to uncover the Type 2 AC connector. If the lower one also pulls away to reveal two larger pins, then it has the CCS rapid charge capability. If the lower cover is fixed in place, and doesn't pull free, then it doesn't have the CCS capability and is not a rapid charge model.",2022,5,12

"Decision made today. We’ve agreed on a deal for a “Celadon Blue” GT Line with rapid charging. According to Johnny’s wife on the Late Brake Show this means my better half is a middle aged woman called “Hazel”  . We disagree though: really like the colour and more importantly the way it drives & high up seating position. 
 
Thanks for all the comments and advice above. We felt we made an informed decision including noting of the abysmal NCAP score. For our use case (almost all urban, 30 mph roads) we feel we can live with it. On the other hand we’re getting a car that could, on the odd occasion, comfortably do long distance trips and carry adult passengers, and we’re saving a few 1000 quid compared with current competition (Mini, Fiat, Honda - we didn’t test a VW E-up though). 
 
We have everything we wanted on the car we’ve picked with the possible exception of heated seats (we may look at getting an aftermarket retrofit but will see how we get on come the colder months first). 
 
We’ve also ordered a 3 pin charger having found one to be invaluable for trips away in our Tesla. I seem to recall that the Tesla mobile connector does bad things to the Zoe - not sure if this is still the case? but we think a separate charger for the Zoe will be a worthwhile investment.",2022,5,15
"OK, I'm confused but I'm sure someone here can help me, also if this question has been asked and answered ad nauseam - I apologise - but like I said, I'm new here. 
 
1. My understanding was the Ampera battery would charge to a 50 mile capacity, only getting 38 miles range coming up on the dash after 10 hour overnight charge, what am I doing wrong. 
2. I want to run the petrol engine first thing to warm/demist/heat seats etc and thought I could do this using the HOLD mode, problem is the HOLD mode is greyed out, what am I doing wrong. 
3. When you look at the power train screen and the engine is surrounded with the glowing green halo, does this mean the engine is running? 
4. Is there any advantage in getting the most powerful home charge assembly or is the one supplied with the car when plugged into a good 10amp socket just as good?

@ Richard_Gledhill What I meant was the using L you are missing out on any regen that happens when going downhill - especially when using the cruise control. When in L the car's speed increases when in D it is more controlled with the regen. I hope that explains roughly what I was trying to point out.,2015,10,23

"Yes sorry, the dealer confused me, the R40 is the 'old' version and the Q210 the 'new' - right? Glad to have the support and advice of the forum, even the keen dealerships don't seem to have much of a clue. BTW, as an aside, the dealer showed us a cute trick involving closing the door, resetting the trip, closing the door again etc etc anyhow, long story short, he succeeded in 'freeing' the reserve charge and putting it 'in the tank' increasing the shown mileage from 80 to 120. Is this smoke and mirrors, also is there a similar dodge for the AMPERA, I'd just love to get at the 25% reserve, not all of it just another 5 miles or so,",2015,10,26
"Believe me you don't want the reserve - it's there to keep the battery life. You could use the reserve if you wanted to (if Vauxhall allowed it) and then your batteries would lose their capacity after a few years... That's why it's not a reserve, it's a buffer there to protect the battery life.

R240 is new with reduced maximum charge rate Q210 has the larger charge rate.

"All it does is change the throttle pedal so that effectively all the travel is in the first inch or so of travel and after that it makes no difference. However at higher speeds (> about 40mph) it keeps the main motor engaged rather than switching in the smaller motor, which is slightly less efficient but gives instant response as it then doesn't need to swap back again if you put your foot down again.",2015,10,30
"I also find the 'normal' setting only really allows for around 60kW, unless you slam the pedal, i.e. it is very non-linear at the end of the travel in 'normal' while 'sport' gives you a linear response from 0 (or -50kW if in regen!) to 111kW.

For instance VW lose money on the Phaeton because it sells in tiny numbers but they want a ""halo"" vehicle. Bugatti lost as much money as they received from the buyer on every Veyron, but again it's a halo effect on the brand and the brand's group (also VW group). Renault make a loss on their large saloons too, and so on. 
Actually the biggest money spinners are vehicles with an extensive and pricey options list; that's just pure profit for the car makers.",2015,11,3

They should have never expected to make money on the Ampera - it's basically a test bed to validate and show off the technology and gather customer reaction, battery usage feedback etc. Their mistake was that someone, somewhere decided to try and make money from it. Let's be honest, they probably spent the best part of a billion dollars developing the entire Ampera's system - you're never going to make that back from car sales of one niche model over a 3 year period.",2015,11,3

"They just need to use the drivetrain in other vehicles. Part of the reason the Ampera didn't sell was down to the practicalities, the four seats, the somewhat 'scattergun' approach to the design of the centre console. Don't get me wrong, my last car 'only' had four seats and you get used to the touch sensitive buttons (though they never get easy). But the drivetrain could be used in other cars, after all the engines used in an Astra aren't unique to that model, they could even license it to other manufacturers (eg I think the Agila was a shared platform with Suzuki and used some Suzuki engines). They technology would then start to become more familiar to the buying public.  
 
A good example of this approach is how VW/Audi are planning to extend the GTE/eTron ranges and Mitsubishi are expecting to release PHEV ASX's, Lancers and Shoguns.",2015,11,3

By using the same drivetrain components across ranges of cars, it is then a short step to add a bigger battery and a charging socket, both technically speaking and also from the marketing perspective.

"You get 2.7kWh per litre around town and 3kWh per litre on a long run. It's pretty much fixed. How many miles that actually takes you is the same variability as how far the battery takes you on the same energy.

... or unless it's chucking it down with rain. The momentum needed to accelerate rain from 0mph to 70mph is considerable and in heavy rain it can knock up to 5mpg off!! ,2015,11,6
"Forgive me for revisiting the ""D vs L"" topic, but I'm not sure that everything was made clear. And as has been pointed out before, I seem to enjoy being wordy... 
 
The *only* difference between ""D"" and ""L"" is the mapping for the acceleration and regen. That's it. Whether in ""D"" or ""L"" it doesn't matter one bit with regards to efficiency other than how the driver drives it. Now, with that said... 
 
The most-efficient mode of travelling is *coasting* and not using regenerative braking (or any braking). When you're trying to hypermile and eek out the most mileage out of the battery that you possibly can then you are actively looking for opportunities to travel while avoiding any braking at all. So, when you're approaching a stop or slower traffic you will want to coast for as long as possible before braking. If you can coast and reach the stop with only ever needing to press the brake from, say, 5-10 mph, then you did very well. Of course, doing so will annoy the drivers behind you, so that level of aggressive hypermiling is really not appropriate in traffic, but even when in traffic you can employ the same principles as much as is appropriate. 
 
Now, the issue I mean to clarify is this: it is *much* easier to coast in ""D"" than in ""L"". For the most part if you let go of the pedals in ""D"" then you are coasting. (Yes, there is some regen there, but it's very insignificant.) It's much more-difficult to find that coasting spot when in ""L"". 
 
However, ""L"" does make driving in stop-and-go traffic much easier *and* ""L"" is extremely useful on long downhill stretches when you may not want your brake lights to be constantly lit up (as the driver behind you will not know when you're slowing or not if your brake lights are permanently on). 
 
So, when I drive I am almost always in ""D"", and when I can coast I do so. However, when I'm in slow, heavy traffic or when I am on a long, downhill stretch I will use ""L"". And that's really what most others here are saying - so... that was a lot of words to say nothing additional, probably.",2015,11,12
Well clarified Lee! And thank you for putting in the bit about being considerate to other drivers too. And also thank you for not proposing the dangerous and completely pointless approach of going into N to coast.,2015,11,12
"Just on the subject of coasting down slowly..... 
 
... There are circumstances where I would naturally agree with you, e.g. approaching a give way/stop junction. But approaching lights that have just turned red, or approaching a stationary queue of traffic, no, I am not going to 'drive up' to the lights and brake at the last minute, I am going to let the car coast naturally. Many is the time I have come up in an empty lane of a multiple lane junction with some truck, white van or BMW bearing down on me because I haven't been exceeding the speed limit until the last 5 yards before the stop, and then, ah, fancy that, the lights change just as I get there! They do do this after a while! Who'd have thought it! So I go sailing through with carry-on speed, leaving the other lanes for dead, and the lunatics behind have actually been advantaged by my driving, not disadvantaged. 
 
Yes, many is the time people have pulled out and overtaken me as I slow down gradually for red lights.... only for me to sail past them again because, of course, they have had to brake and stop..... 
 
I will drive in a way that is of maximum benefit to all,  even if their puny brains cannot comprehend what I am doing!!!!",2015,11,12

"No-one, anywhere, has yet reported battery degradation in a Volt/Ampera, and there are a lot of them about world-wide. 
 
Not to say it doesn't, or hasn't (!) happened, but no documented, verifiable instances have found their way into the public domain yet, AFAIK. 
 
The packs were very accurately matched for cell balance and high manufacturing tolerances, are arranged in triple cells, and have a very active thermal management. 
 
Of course, outright faults can occur with any device, and there have been incidents of battery problems. But nothing credible seen in regards Volt/Ampera battery degradation yet. 
 
In winter it becomes very heavily dependent on how you use the car. I did several short town journeys the other week and was headed towards less than 25 miles on one battery charge! Didn't matter as that was enough, but I am still expecting to be back up to mid-50's in summer. 
 
Reality is that electric charge displaces fuel, at a pretty given rate. [Generalisation warning!...] Each full battery charge saves you 4 litres of fuel. It doesn't sound like a huge amount, but it sure adds up, especially if you are doing an extra charge during the day!

It is an estimate, there are no absolutes of battery charge measurement for any Li-ion. Only your real range is important and objective, and in winter, for any EV, that can be a half of your summer range if you 'use' the car and make good use of the heater. 
 
If you have an energy monitor attached to the line to the charge point, this can also provide a measure of 'consistency', which is probably more reliable than the on board battery diagnostics. My full battery charge (from the 'wall') varies from ~11.5kWh to ~12.2kWh real energy consumed. Typically it is consistently around 11.5kWh if I have run the car down to reading '0km' or '1km' on the range estimate, or variable if it has gone to petrol (the buffer can then vary significantly).

I am of the same faith as you. 
The single bulb projector halogens are awful but do take HID's very well. Dazzle is I think far less than with halogens as the cut off is better with HIDS. 
 
See  Headlights  for a recent post about this. 
 
My supplier preference is HIDS4U but only because I have had three sets from them, one set on each of my EV's. They are a little more expensive but I hope they are better. 
 
My only complaint was that the supply cables from the old halogen plug to the HID control box are the wrong way round but nothing was damaged and the pins are easy to swap over.

I'm struggling to see it as a 'must have' item, but perhaps I'm missing something? 
 
In general it doesn't feel like it gets cold enough, for long enough in the UK to make it worthwhile. 
 
If this was Norway it would be different, but for us here in the UK is it a vital purchase or just an interesting option?",2022,5,26
"Not for £900. Our current Soul EV does have a heat pump, but our annual EV leccy bill is under £100 on Go Faster / solar charging. I can’t be sure how much more leccy we’d have to buy to cover the lower winter efficiency, but let’s say it’s another £20 a year. If we kept the car for 5 years the heat pump is only going to have saved about £100 in leccy. 
 
I can only see this being worthwhile if someone has a winter commute that is marginal on range and the extra heat pump efficiency would come into play. Even then, there is pre heating, heated seats and heated wheel to mitigate using the heater on the move a little less, and of course the 4 trim has rear heated seats so everyone should have a warm bum",2022,5,26
"I don't have one on mine, and after one winter I can't say I miss it much. It might be a different story if I was in the habit of making long trips in the winter, if the extra power consumption meant an extra stop to charge or if the cost of the extra electricity was significant. I don't have a lot of heat on in the car anyway and set it to 19C, preferring to dress appropriately for cold weather. 
 
PS I don't have heated seats or steering wheel either (Niro 2)!",2022,5,26
I suggest the heat pump is less important in view of the size of the battery. My first electric car was a Nissan Leaf and I think the heat pump really made a difference to its limited range. Unless range is critical to you I do not think the heat pump is so important.,2022,5,26

It's more like 5% on longer trips.  @stageshoot  did a post about it a while ago where he also mentioned this.

"Having this heat-pump-or-not dilemma currently. The ""Niro EV 4 MY23"" will be a 4 year lease but we'd have to pay the full price for the heat pump, so £900 over the 4 years (£18.75/mo). Considering we won't recoup anything in lower depreciation and we'd only benefit the minimal energy cost savings for a maximum of 4 years anyway, it seems stupid to get the heat pump from a purely cost perspective. 
 
However, that's only one factor. Another factor is range. We currently have a MY20 4 trim with a heat pump so we'd be losing range in the winter. Lots of different calculations out there but it sounds as if ~10 miles lost over a ~200 mile trip is a decent estimate in 0-5 C weather. The new Niro has ~3 miles extra range supposedly, so call it ~7 miles lost overall. Our longest trip that we expect to complete in a single charge is ~215 miles, so this could make the difference...maybe? We'd likely only do this trip once a year in winter though so, again, it seems silly to get a heat pump just for that. 
 
Yet another factor is time-to-heat. We'll be doing daily short trips so the lack of a heat pump will presumably mean the cabin will warm up more slowly? It'll surely mean more energy will be used for these trips also (but definitely not £18.75/mo worth of energy!). Maybe this can be mitigated with pre-conditioning but that assumes the car is plugged in each night (or that we remember to manually do it each morning).

 residual value when I do eventually sell the car 
 reduced energy consumption (along with using heated seats first in winter, and ventilated seats first in summer) 
 potential for marginally more overall mileage on longer journeys (as one of my regular trips is close to the real-world 250 miles)

Having a heat pump in a car which is subject to movement and potential water/ salt water ingress seems to me to be completely different to a domestic heat pump setup where it does not move and 50% of it is inside the house. Cars are complicated enough so I decided to not add the heat pump on my NIro 4 order.

I wouldn't expect them to have an EV in the fleet. Considering they've had my car longer than I have and they have the car in with Nissan, I thought maybe they could speak to Nissan about getting a car off them whilst mine is in, with Fiat covering the cost for the inconvenience. 
 
Regarding my driving style, I am driving exactly the same as I do / did in my Leaf where I was achieving over 4mpkwh (albeit with a broken heater). I set off in the garage down a fairly flat road at 65mph and 10 miles later coming off there the economy was 33mpg. Driving locally (hills and short trips due to work) has reduced this further. It's an NA Petrol (not one of these new turbo petrol engines) so really struggles with performance.  
 
Ordinary 500 is no good with a wife, 3 year old and 4 week old unfortunately. 
 
It's just a bit of a kick in the teeth when the car is costing me 20p per mile give or take to drive, whilst mine is sitting in a garage stripped down (don't know what sitting for 5 weeks will do to my battery health) and my Polar Plus membership is going unused.",2019,1,24

"I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK.

Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to :  How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper  
 
Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years.

"Crazy! perhaps a bit too much time in that Californian sun. 
 
A car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, will not make a convenient city runabout! 
Not to mention and shipping costs and import duties will probably cost the same as several monthly car payments",2020,11,19
"Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import. 
 
I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it. 
 
But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above. 
 
Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.",2020,11,19
"Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry 
 
So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout. 
 
Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.",2020,11,19
As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.,2020,11,19
Import duty will be the biggest problem I reckon. Unless there’s some kind of exemption for bringing over your own personal car (which I doubt).,2020,11,19
"When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months. 
 
 If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.  
 
Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.",2020,11,19
Always a good idea to get the pros and cons down on a piece of paper and cost against alternatives.,2020,11,19
"Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria. 
 
Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.",2020,11,19
"Do it!  
 
There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting. 
 
p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me   Sounds perfect for bombing round town.",2020,11,19
It’s not difficult to change lanes or navigate roundabouts in a small LHD car in the U.K.,2020,11,19
Would it be considered rude to point out that Fiat are now taking orders for a much improved 500e to Europe & the UK for the 2021 model year?,2020,11,19
"Is it $5000 plus importation costs? or will it be more expensive than that? 
 
So for an extra 20k you can have much improved..... I am assuming range, how much would that be per mile of additional and possibly un needed city car range.",2020,11,19
"The California spec. Fiat 500e doesn't have rapid charging, but I suppose you already know that.",2020,11,19
Best to get an insurance quote too. Car is an oddball and some companies won't insure it.,2020,11,19
"Thought this would get people in the mood for the holiday   
 
I gave it a go and got matched up with the Nissan Leaf surprise surprise, be good to see what you all get matched up with..  
 Looking for ‘the one’? Take our quiz to find your perfect car! - Car Keys",2016,2,12
Leaf too -- why do I think that's their token EV..?,2016,2,12
"Impreza WRX STI, oooops ! 
 
EDIT: Just ran the test again, this time it was a Civic Type R ...... I think I'm in denial ",2016,2,12
"I got the Fiat 500 Storm Trooper edition. 
 
At least that car looks like a storm trooper, as opposed to the white i3",2016,2,12
Subaru again...,2016,2,12
Civic Type R,2016,2,12
BMW 3 series! Have to say I found it hard to choose an answer that fitted me for some questions so not too surprised it fixed me up with a car I wouldn't actually choose in reality.,2016,2,12
"Just thought I'd do a thread on what having a Corsa E is like. I often find test drives and reviews don't really find some of the issues that owners have all the time. 
 
Driving: pretty good. Far more lively than the Leaf. Ride quality is a bit more bobbly and unsettled but it's a lot firmer and less of a blancmange. It's more like the Zoe R90 I had but a bit taughter. It's more eager to get up and go than the Leaf and a lot more eager than the Zoe R110 which seemed subdued compared to the R90. It doesn't hop on bumps like the Zoe either. It seems to be better controlled in the rear. 
 
Interior does have a lot of scratchy cheap plastic. I can't hear any of it squeaking or rattling though yet so that's a bonus. The suspension is more noisy than the Leaf but I have to check all the stuff in the under boot floor section is secure as if the towing eye is in there that might explain the odd noises from the rear. Seat and steering wheel are properly adjustable and there is a foot rest. 
 
First job has been to get the Vauxhall connect app working. The website and app look very like the Nissan one... the connect process is the same. Mine is still in the process of sorting itself out. It can see the car and where it is but there isn't the battery details yet (ie the bit I want). Hopefully that will happen over the weekend. 
 
Most annoying thing found so far is the bluetooth audio seems reluctant to connect and start with that as a source each time. I keep getting the radio   I'm hoping once I've been in it a few times it will stop being thick and just reconnect and carry on where it left off. Annoyingly getting back into the Leaf from having set up the corsa at the showroom the Leaf did exactly that.  
 
The vauxhall website suggests you get 3 years free servicing but there seems to be some doubt with the dealer whether that applies with the ex demo cars. That was one of the reasons I was attracted to the Corsa so it will be annoying if there is that exclusion and the website hasn't made it clear. It does say Corsa E up to 10 months old so I'd expect any sold before the end date should qualify.  
 
There are no mats as they're on back order. I have ordered some normal 2020 corsa ones from amazon to use for now. Dealer has been waiting since the beginning of time for the mats. 
 
I still haven't found out whether you can use the heater/stereo etc while rapid charging either. This is a slight concern as it was on my list of things that would exclude having a model altogether.",2020,8,21
"Hello all , been lurking since early 2021 , we got our Corsa November 2020 , been pleased with it so far but started having a few issues the past couple of weeks , When plugging in to charge it will cut off after a couple of minutes , i have tried using the Vauxhall App to set it to Immediate charge but it will not let me toggle between that and Deferred charge , so as it stands i cannot charge . 
I Have also tried to charge overnight using our podpoint charger but the last 3 out of 4 charging schedules have failed to charge , any advise would be appreciated .",2022,1,21
"We've had an issue with the charging points at the new building where my wife works, seems to work briefly then stops. We initially though it was the cable that came with the car as it was the only place we used it, its normally charged from a tethered Pod Point at home that works fine but we've seen used the cable with no issues elsewhere so that appears to be fine.  
 
I think you can alter the deferred charge bit from in the car as well so could be worth trying from there.",2022,1,21
"Just waiting for Vauxhall to get back to me to see if it is a APP issue , i have cleared the Podpoint timer settings but was told by podpoint that settings should be applied to each day regardless if you charge or not . 
 "" For the schedule to work seamlessly and charge within the scheduled hours, you need a schedule set up for each day even if you don't plan on plugging in and charging on that day, as the unit searches for schedules only within that specific day. If you have any schedule set up by your car it could overwrite schedule set up by PodPoint. """,2022,1,21
"Checked the car in to the dealer today to see if they can diagnose the 'Electric Traction Motor Fault: Repair Needed' message that we have had a few times. The RAC said there were fault codes against both motor and battery when they checked it out last week. Dealer is unaware of any later software versions that include a percentage battery level, saying that none of their cars in stock have this, even new ones. Seems to think I'm a bit of a weird nerd for continuing to suggest that such a thing exists.... So I'm not confident they will be doing anything to it.",2022,1,24
"The new corsa-e cars do have the ability to show the battery percentage. 
You have to press the button on the left hand stork which scrolls through trip 1, trip 2 and I think the final one is current. The current option shows the instantaneous power usage above that shows the battery percentage but only in the newer cars, I don't know a specific date or firmware version this has been changed. My Corsa is a 2020 model and has the latest update available from October 2021(when I updated it) no other updates have been made available as far as I can tell for this age of car. 
 
Don't know if it will happen, hope so as it would be so useful to have the 4segment battery display and percentage instead of my 8 segment battery display only.",2022,1,24
The weird thing is how the multi segment display goes from 0 to 1 rather than 0 to 100. Even that would have made slightly more sense. 10% divisions would also have been easier to understand. All a missed opportunity really.,2022,1,24
Little gripe with the Corsa-e.....ran out of washer fluid this morning on the way to work this morning. My Insignia lets you know when its getting low but seems they didnt bother adding this feature to the Corsa which is a little annoying. Would be handy to know its getting low rather than have to top up just to find out. More annoying as i went to the Sainsburys petrol station near work to use the air and water machine which has always been free only to find they are now charging for it! Not wallet busting but annoying they've decided to follow the lead of other petrol stations that do this...didnt look what they were charging but the fact there was a contactless pay option on it wasnt encouraging!,2022,1,24
I'm surprised it doesn't have a low washer fluid warning. Not had a car in ages that doesn't.,2022,1,24
"Anyone else had the infotainment screen go completely black? Doesn't show anything at all. I can still control the radio with the steering wheel buttons, though. Turning the car off and on again hasn't helped. Got maintenance booked for Tuesday, but I'm wondering if there some fixes I can try myself.",2022,1,28
"Hello everyone. Hopefully, this is the right place to ask this. 
I test drove Opel Corsa-e (first reg November 2020) and I loved it! I currently have fiat 500, with 13.5s to 100... Corsa was on another level, heaps above that. And I loved how it hugged the road... I was a bit shocked by how fast the range indicator was going down though, driving it in sports through some bends and ups and downs... and a few km at 150 and 130 on the motorway... but okay, it is what it is... and I was researching charging stations after I came home, and it's not that bad to charge it... and 95% of the time we will charge it at home. 
 
now for the main issue... infotainment/main screen was VERY lackluster. There is a phone, nav, photos/SMS, music, and very few car settings, like auto-dimming the lights, auto-locking etc... 
I and wifey were trying to get some battery management stuff to come up, but we could only get some basic version of it on the driver's screen. 
we went into the handbook, and there was mention of ""eflow"" button, etc... but our car simply didn't have that. Our car seems to have a smaller screen and no buttons to the left and right of the volume knob. 
 
I then went searching for reviews online and they all have those buttons... so what the f. is up with that? 
car in question:  Opel Corsa :: Avtonet ::  
here is the google translate link:  Opel Corsa :: Avtonet ::  
 
how the car was...",2022,2,2
Am i right in thinking that the buttons that would normally be around the volume button are actually either side of the infotainment screen?,2022,2,3
"yes, usually the buttons that should be real buttons next to the volume knob were in this car next to the screen and just touch buttons... and the screen is smaller because of the buttons on the side. 
Clicking on the 4 squares only brought up SMS and gallery app. Trust me, I tried all different options to get to some interesting energy/electric menu, but there was nothing. No way of setting at what time to charge, or to preheat the car... or any of other cool ""electric"" stuff... I do know that it can also be setup in the phone app, but yeah I want an option to do that from the car. 
As I said, I was shocked by how bad the infotainment was. And then I came home and checked some reviews and it just seems this infotainment had a bunch of stuff missing. It feels like it is some kind of pre-production version. It seems they installed infotainment from ICE car or something like that...",2022,2,3
"From memory the infotainment system only really has the car diagram which shows you energy flow to and from the battery, and then the energy consumption graph. If you didn’t have either that is very weird…",2022,2,3
"Unless there are regional variances I’m really surprised it didn’t have the e button. The app relies on having Vauxhall connected services (Opel I guess) so one has to wonder whether this would have that or not? 
 
Id be walking away if it’s missing the e button. You’d have no information at all.  
 
Really curious to see if that’s normal in your region.",2022,2,3
I'm guessing the E button is there. It's part of the piano black plastic next to the volume knob rather than a separate button. I'd wager the white marking has just been taken off by someone at the dealer using strong chemicals to clean the interior. Alcohol wipes or something similar. It's been used as a demo during the pandemic so the touch surfaces will likely have seen a ton of cleaning.,2022,2,3
"Interesting. I had a look through autotrader here and none of the oldest SE navs (base trim) are missing the button. However all the oldest cars were elites with the big 10"" display unit - I wonder if we didn't get the lower trim levels till later? Intriguing.",2022,2,3
"@tsanteri  ah okay... that clears things up! thanks a lot. 
 
So my suspicion was correct... it seems that early models had literally just ICE infotainment... and any electric stuff that there is, is on the driver's screen... 
now I wonder how old it is... it was registered in Nov 2020, but I got to ask when it was made... if it was made in early 2020, then the battery is already 2 years old. I know there is 8 years warranty for a 70% state of charge... but still, a year is a year... 
 
Do you think 23k€ is a good price for it? 
I am afraid that someday, the app will stop working on certain phones... or Opel will cancel the app, or it becomes a paid feature... you never know what happens in 5 years... ah man it's such a bummer that you can't do things within a car... :// 
 
I wonder if they can update infotainment...",2022,2,3
"That's weird as! 
 
I've got an early SE nav and always thought mine was the most basic level of trim they had been released with. Seems pointless to have the functionality but have to go through the app.",2022,2,3
How strange they changed the trim,2022,2,4
All those in Vauxhalls prior to the takeover by Stellantis lost app access etc as OnStar was closed down. I've a defunct button in my Insignia now for OnStar...not that i paid £99 a year for it anyway. I used the free year and all i used the app for was occasionally locking and unlocking the car!,2022,2,8
"The dealer lent me a car with very basic infotainment exactly like this, with no buttons, when mine was in for a service. I assumed it was a cheaper trim level.",2022,2,9
"We're taking our Corsa-e in for its second year service soon. Honestly it's been pretty solid since the system upgrade it had last year where it introduced the proximity locking and unlocking, and a few other things. 
 
Our situation at home has now changed since we took the car out at the beginning of the first lockdown. We sold our second car (a Ford Ka) and the Corsa-e is now our primary vehicle. Longer journeys in the Corsa-e can be a bit of a faff with the pessimistic GoM and the quite poor efficiency at high speed. Also, with plans for a family in sight, it seems the small Corsa-e might not cut it for the remainder of our 4 year plan. 
 
I'm going to inquire about the feasibility of swapping our Corsa-e for a new MG ZS Long Range, but reckon I am setting myself up for disappointment! Might update here if and when I remember! I reckon at the moment that we'll end up sticking out the remaining 2 years and see what's what then. I'm just not looking forward to cramming baby gear in this thing.",2022,2,10
"I actually tried putting baby gear in the corsa e when I was baby sitting my niece. The buggy fits if you remove the flap at the back. The baby seat was a nightmare to put in at night, as there is no light at the back. Overall I would definitely recommend getting a bigger car as it’s a struggle for baby gear.",2022,2,10
Has anyone had an issue where you get a repeated clunking noise when accelerating from stationary with the wheel far turned. Like when you are turning left out of a T junction.,2022,2,19
"@Beckyed880  
 
Have you gone into the climate menu and turned the base fan speed up? That does help a little with the heating.",2022,2,22
"That’s how most cars work. That’s just air passing through the car ventilation system when moving at speed. 
 
The solution is shutting the vent(s). 
 
The only car I’ve experienced that didn’t pass air through the vents when off was a MK7.5 Fiesta with automatic climate control. The Fiesta with manual air conditioning did however - Ford made a note in the manual explaining Fiestas with ACC fitted should always leave the system on or open the window, otherwise there would be no cabin ventilation.",2022,2,23
"Hey All, 
 
Quick question re: handsfree entry. I had this option in the settings of my Corsa E but it was never working. It's an occasion but was still running on 2020 software when I got it. I've updated my car to the latest software version and now the handsfree/key less entry option is gone (lol?). Maybe my car is too old to have that proximity entry feature?",2022,2,28
"I think there’s two separate features here - possibly separated by model year. 
 
There’s keyless entry via placing your hand on the door handle and touching the sensor that unlocks the car which has always been hit and miss for me. 
 
There is also proximity unlock were the car will just unlock when it detects you next to it with the key without having to touch a thing (and consequently lock as you walk away). 
 
I’ve turned the latter off as I didn’t particularly like it and I always use the key to deadlock it anyway. 
 
I also had mine in for its first service the other day. Two things to note: 
 
The water issue I mentioned previously in this thread - they’ve had to replace some grommets somewhere in the boot as they were leaking water in although I’ve been asked to keep an eye on it as they’re not fully convinced it’s solved the issue completely. When I had their courtesy car, a bog standard petrol Corsa, I checked the boot in that and found it wet underneath the boot floor but on the opposite side. I’d encourage others to check their boots every now and then to check the same issue doesn’t occur on theirs. 
 
Secondly, I pushed them on the lack of battery percentage on the dash for the older models (and different segment display, colour change based on drive mode etc) - the tech checked everything he could and there’s no option to enable it on their side via any of their configuration tools or, currently, any available update for the car that might possibly include it. 
 
Maybe Vauxhall will release an update in the future to enable it on older models but who knows. I’ve tried to get an answer from Vauxhall directly on this but I’ve got nowhere so I’ve given up. Will have to stick with checking via the app.",2022,2,28
"Android app update has landed yesterday, version is 1.34.0, looks like they have screwed up the range and miles again,only noticed some UI changes on the home page, but definitely reporting kilometres for me🤷‍♂️",2022,3,4
I had the pin thing. I can't remember how I fixed it. Might have just been by logging out of the app and logging back in or going full nuclear and deleting the car and the app and starting again. It's all a bit fuzzy now 🙃,2022,3,4
When that happens to me the only fix is to totally delete the app and re-download it again,2022,3,4
Tronity were adding some car controls in to their app. It's worth checking it out.,2022,3,4
"Looking through my service paperwork from the other day and it seems they’re saying the brake pads are 10% worn at only 5k miles. 
 
Given I’m usually always in B mode and rarely ever touch the brakes at all I’m a bit baffled at that. Anyone else noticed something similar?",2022,3,5
Anybody got any experience of granny chargers? I know you can buy 3rd party to avoid the crazy price Vauxhall one? Is the one with my BMW 330e likely to work safely do you think? Little bit wary of trying it but unless it's doing any custom communication with the vehicle electrics I would assume it just transfers electricity and doesnt care what it's plugged into?,2022,3,7
"Yes, your BMW granny lead will work. The communication protocol is not car specific.",2022,3,9
Quick MyVauxhall app question...can you have it on more than one phone? I've got it installed on my phone currently but when my wife has the car at work and wants to make sure its charging ok as its been a bit hit and miss in terms of working either she has to go out to the car or I have to check via my phone. Would be handy if it could be checked from both our phones.,2022,3,11
"Hi all, 
Has anyone noticed that the gom gets very pessimistic when the SOC gets to 50% or below. 
E.g SOC of 38% GOM was 38miles. 
I don't do excessive speed, mostly used for commuting and shopping, no real long trips recently. 
Lowest SOC has been 22%, as no home charging, it get charged at work on a weekly basis, or on DC rapids to 80ish% 
Car is the Corsa E Griffin, registered September 2021.",2022,3,12

"Hey all, 
 
Quick question. I'm always charging at a public charger that is 11kwh. How many KM should it charge per hour? I've never paid attention to this when charging but yesterday it was only charging with 14km/h and the next day the battery was only at 70% while I left it over night.. Today I went to the same public charger and now it's not even charging. So I'm trippin wether is the car or the charging spot. I went to a different public charger (11kwh) and it's charging with 28km per hour. Currently at 57% and still 4 hours to go. Seems about right?",2022,3,13
App may have been updated again.. Font colours have changed to black and the GoM is now miles out; its suggesting 134 miles on a 50% SoC while in car it's showing 89 miles available...,2022,3,13
"Hello, 
 
Has anyone ever driven a long trip (1000km+) with the Corsa E? I recently did my longest trip ever which was around 260 km (back and forth it was 520km) and it went decent, charged two times for around 20 mins on the way there and one long stop (around one hour at a fastcharger) on the way back. 
 
Now here's the deal: we are thinking of doing a roadtrip to Budapest (from Amsterdam) this summer and apps like Chargemap and Fastned are great, but they always send you to chargers with only 10/15% of battery left and that leaves me a little afraid of encountering a charger that doesn't work and too little battery of making it to the next one.  
 
I'd love to hear your experiences with doing longer trips with this car!",2022,3,14
"A better route planner definitely allows it, so would recommend you check if it works for your countries",2022,3,14
"Hi there   
 
I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april. 
 
So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol. 
 
Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too. 
 
I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol. 
 
i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh. 
 
anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3  
 
would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one. 
 
many thanks",2022,2,3
"Mode 3 is the granny cable. See my earlier thread on this as its confusing. After Aug last year, any order placed on the fiat system, regardless of trim level, will come with the 'faster' charge cable. However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard. The dealer had led me to believe the 2nd cable would be included, so in my case they provided the cable free of charge.",2022,2,4
Just did and it is indeed the one you use at public chargers or home wallboxes,2022,2,4
"A lot of EV for £22k, despite its origins. Definitely still a big “no” from this house for many, many reasons though.",2021,10,30
And from this. What customer service will they provide?,2021,10,30
Another no here too. Looked good from the front but then went downhill in terms of price and practicality with that small boot. Nothing really made it stand out from the crowd other than it’s from a new (to us) Chinese brand. Zoe would be the better bet I think.,2021,10,30
"Tried and tested so I wouldn't have any problems with that. 
However, if you did have problems, the dealer network just won't be there. 
Probably going to be a Daewoo/Vauxhall network type of thing so won't end well. 
But I do like it, being made in China might make me think twice also though. 
Read they're hoping to buy an old nissan factory in Spain so maybe built there in future. 
Top spec, bigger battery, gt pack will be 30k easily. 
Is it enough to shake up the market?- I'd say its not cheap enough, yet.",2021,10,30
"And that GT version! What a visual abomination with various bits of plastic stuck all over it with a bright red ‘GT’ on the rear spoiler! Ok for cars that have the extra umph to back up the visuals, but when its the exact same car underneath it’s a bit embarrassing!",2021,10,30
"It'll be much the same as when Datsun first started selling cars here in the early 1970's. They had virtually no dealer network, plus the cars had some pretty dubious design features, not to mention names (who came up with the idea of calling a car the Cherry or the Sunny?). The rate of growth of Datsun was pretty remarkable though. Within ten years they went from selling around 1,000 cars a year to having the largest market share of any imported make. Good move by them to revert to the Nissan name, though, IMHO.",2021,10,30
"Reckon ""Sunny"" on a par for cringe with ""Princess"" 👸

"Certainly the quality improved very rapidly, but they really weren't that great in the early 1970's. Back when Datsun first started selling cars here they rusted out faster than pretty much anything going, including rust buckets like all the BL cars, although I don't think they were as bad as cars like the Lancias, they rusted so quickly that they would often fail their first MOT on severe corrosion. A colleague bought a brand new Lancia Beta in the mid-1970s, only for it to be written off as being beyond economic repair when it failed it's first MOT for being badly affected by structural corrosion.",2021,10,30

Refused the offer of Admiral's ""approved"" body shop as I wanted to make sure it went to a Renault approved place. Probably equally bad but at least it keeps everything OK with the Renault warranty - they can't do anything till next Monday so I'm without a car for a week.

It needed the boot floor replacing, new tail gate, new bumper, various fixings and paint. Repair cost £2500 all in, which in the scheme of things for an insurance co is peanuts.

Been twatted from behind about 4 times in 20+ years driving, and once head on by a drunk driver in an Escort while driving my mini.

"The saga continues.... Finally Admiral got the car to the Renault Approved body shop yesterday. On inspecting the car it seems the battery cooler is under the boot floor and is mangled. So now the garage can't work on it as they're not authorised to work on the electrical system... The damage has been estimated at £5.5k  
 
So admiral now need to find a garage that can make the electrics safe before the repair can begin. All this time I'm without a courtesy car as they are supplied by the repairing garage, of which there isn't one yet!

"Bit of an update... 
 
Basically nothing has happened in the 6 weeks since the accident. Admiral couldn't find anyone willing to work on it due to the damage to Battery Rad and related HV isolation - local Renault garages seemingly only have 1 person trained in EV vehicles and they all seemed to be on Holiday at the time so the car went to a garage in Nottingham who supposedly knew what they were doing. 
 
After assessing the damage at £7.1k - must be so close to a write off given how much a 2k mile Ex Demonstrator would be - they ordered parts etc. Initial estimate was Thursday this week for completion. Called today to check how they were getting on and they have been waiting for repair methods from RMI before they could even start. These are now through but still 17 working days of repair before it's finished.... I wish I'd pushed Admiral to get it into Renault but at the time it seemed these guys could crack on immediately - how wrong was I. 
 
Got a Brand New Fiat 500 as a courtesy car so not too bad but I'm bored of it now and just want the Zoe back. 
 
So if you get your Zoe damaged be prepared for a long wait to get it back. This is my first claim in 20+ years of driving and what started quick slickly has ground to a juddering halt. Fingers crossed they do a half decent job and I don't end up rejecting it straight back to them. 
 
Supposedly this mess has been escalated within Admiral so future EV repairs are handled better so it may be that future claims are less painful...",2015,9,7
On Renaults website you are offered free accident co-ordination I believe. You phone them first and they deal with all your claim and tell the insurance firm where its going to be repaired.... apparently.,2015,9,7
"Finally after 12 weeks the Zoe is back  So much nicer than the crappy Fiat 500 I've been running around in for most of that time. 
 
The repair process was a farce with a couple of weeks lost at the start moving car from garage to garage before someone took the repair on. The parts actually came through quickly but then the Bodyshop didn't have the repair processes for the Zoe and that seemed to take weeks. Then finally once it was all back together there was a problem with the Battery Temperature sensor which took the local Renault garage almost 2 weeks to replace  At least the repair looks good with no obvious problems although the light is very flat today so not great for checking... 
 
I think if it had just been a Ford Fiesta it would have been done and dusted in a couple of weeks but I didn't imagine it would take this long. Now to fill out the customer satisfaction survey for Admiral and the Garage...  
 
Forgot to say the final bill was north of £8k!!!!! No idea why the car wasn't written off given the current price of similar mileage ex demonstrators...",2015,10,19

There is no need to hate Toyota to have this opinion. Indeed most large corporations will do whatever they can get away with, but that doesn't make it acceptable.",2020,1,29
I think most intelligent people will realise that hybrids require you to put petrol or diesels into the car and that the ones that do not use plugs to provide the electricity get their battery charged from the petrol / Diesel engine. If the advertising standards agencies don’t like the marketing then I am sure they will do something about it. If you want to complain you can. But it does seem to come across as a bit of an obsession on some of these forums. As others have said there are bigger issues to sort like the charging infrastructure.,2020,1,29
"My opinion has switched. When I had a Self-charging and an ICE, I thought the ad isn't that misleading, after all it does self-charge in some sense, on braking. 
 
Now I have a BEV and a self-charging hybrid, I find the ad irritating and misleading. Like an indoor cordless phone being advertised as a mobile.  
 
The self-charging aspect is irrelevant and miniscule compared to a regular BEV, so IMO shouldn't be allowed in advertising. In the same way health supplements aren't allowed to claim a particular health benefit.",2020,1,29

on the broader point of posts not liking the way Toyota (and others) market hybrids, it will be interesting to see which companies get fined the most because they do not meet European emission targets? Toyota as one of the largest (and profitable) car companies may end up doing ok because of its investment in hybrid technology. However, VW may struggle if it does not produce more BEVs, PHEVs and hybrids. 
If the objective is to reduce emissions then Toyota may be are doing a better job than a lot of other manufacturers? It is also able to maintain profitability and volume. Mercedes seems to be relying on Smart cars and plug in hybrids and may struggle if it does not raise its game. Some like PSA, Fiat etc are merging. Tesla may also become a target for a takeover in order for another to survive. 
So overall, yes it would be nice for Toyota to be clearer in its advertising but in terms of the bigger picture they are doing much better than most other car manufacturers in helping to reduce emissions.",2020,1,30

“...the car battery was charged with no need to plug it into the mains. 
 
Council considered that consumers would interpret the claim “self-charging” in the context of these ads to mean that the car would not have to be plugged in to an external source in order to be charged up, which was how the cars operated.” 
 
Therefore I’d assume that manufacturers would be ok advertising their plug in hybrids as self-charging hybrids or any of their ICEs as self-charging petrol cars.

"I contacted Toyota, as I do periodically to ask about Hydrogen progress:- 
 
""Hello Henry, 
 
 
Thank you for taking the time to getting in contact with us. 
 
Toyota has long been embracing the challenge for low emission mobility. We believe a range of both low-emission and zero-emission technologies such as hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles will all be required to support this necessary transition. 
Together these technologies can help make a significant contribution to overall emissions reduction today and tomorrow whilst at the same time meet the mobility demands of consumers. 
The truth is that we're starting our Hydrogen journey, and building an extensive hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is likely to take many years, there are currently 11 passenger fuelling stations across the U.K with many more development. 
 
Thank you for contacting Toyota. 
 
Kind regards

They seem to be doing everything, or nothing depending on how wary you are!    
When he says that the charging stations are ""across the UK"", they are nearly all in London and the West Country.

There is also one in Aberdeen!!

At least our 10 year old Prius frequently runs in electric mode only (well once I have jump started it as we use it so rarely these days). Actually come to think of it, when I jump start it off a lithium ion battery pack and it initially runs in electric only, does this meet the definition of electric only operation?",2020,2,5

"This is on a par with those companies selling electric resistance heating that claim to be greater than 100% efficient. Toyota must be employing some bright lawyers to go through the exact wording of laws surrounding advertising so that they can be as deceitful as possible without actually breaking the law. I'm still amazed they got away with the ""self-charging hybrid"" crap, TBH.

I can't imagine what it would be like if all the Ubers and minicabs were diesels. Also as traffic moves so slowly they are often in electric mode.  
 
Incidentally we sold our 175k miles Prius (our third one) as soon as we got here and are now on our single Kona as we barely need a car. We bought our first Prius in 2002 and they have proved a very effective gateway, providing enough confidence to get our first BEV in 2013.",2021,7,1

"I measured the energy recovered from regenerative braking for a Prius I owned, back when hybrids were seen as being a very good first step on the path to zero emissions. That car averaged a 14% improvement over a conventional car, partly because of energy recovered during regen, but also because the hybrid system allowed the use of an Atkinson cycle engine, which would have been undriveable with a conventional transmission. Out of that 14% improvement, 8% came from regenerative braking. There is also an issue that at constant speed on a flat road hybrids are less efficient than conventional cars, because of the additional losses in the hybrid system. Their efficiency gain is only achieved during dynamic conditions, where the benefits of energy recovery and the semi-fixed running speeds of the Atkinson engine make a fairly big difference.",2021,7,3
"I, and others here, could do the calcs to see what's really happening, but frankly I'm not going to spend any time on this ""problem"" at all, I have better things to do. Bottom line is there are 2 sorts of perpetual motion machine, one works & one's impossible no matter how you try to arrange hings. 
 
The first variety is impossible. This is the totally sealed black-box device which simply outputs energy forever with no external energy source. We'll assume that mechanical moving parts don't wear out at all, but that things like hysteresis & friction exist and cause inefficiency by diverting some of the energy where you don't want it to go. Typical inventions to achieve this impossible device include things like the magnet which pulls a metal bar towards it, driving a generator which gives you free power (fine so far...) and then all you have to do is insert a little magnetic gate gizmo (under development, needs more financial input to finalise this you understand) which will separate the magnetic link between magnet & bar, allowing you to retract the bar ever so easily to the starting position. Then just open the gate again, the bar is attracted, and the cycle repeats & generates more power for you. Sounds wonderful, but no matter how you try to design & operate the ""magnetic gate"", the energy required to operate it will always exceed the ""free"" energy you get from the bar's motion, so the device will never generate more power out than the input power required to operate it. Even if the mechanicals are frictionless & your generator is 100% efficient & all wires are superconducting, the hysteresis losses in magnetising & de-magnetising iron etc will cause it to be <100% efficient & so fail. Similar ideas include wonderful motors + pumps & generators which somehow produce more energy out than went in. Again, won't work. Except to attract funds from gullible suckers which will not be returned. 
 
The second type works just fine. But this kind isn't a ""sealed black box"", it's simply something that piggy-backs onto an existing source of energy that happens to seem infinite, may well last the life of the universe anyway, and may well be free as well. Windmills, Nuclear power stations, Geothermal energy, Tidal energy, Hydroelectric power etc come into this category. 
 
Think hard about your device, decide which of these 2 categories it comes into, and you have your answer. No calculation required, unless yo decide it's the 2nd type & then decide to make one.",2021,7,4
"As I said before… 
 
",2021,7,4
"Ok, so it's a perpetual motion machine of the 2nd kind, so all you need is a sterling cycle engine (these can run on a very low temperature difference) and couple that to a generator. Or just buy a Peltier device, which despite the very low efficiency might end up generating more power per £ Capital spent on parts. Go make it.",2021,7,4
"In the case from the paper labeled “milk cooling” (Heat pump COP, part 1: Generalized method for screening of system integration potentials -  https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/149827036/Contribution_1380_final.pdf  - Page 4 Table 1) the heat source is 68F milk. The compressor creates a 149F region and a 39F region due to compression and expansion of a circulating coolant. The 39F region absorbs heat from the 68F milk before being compressed. The 149F region transfers the acquired heat to the hot side of the stirling engine. The cold side of the stirling engine is the 68F milk. At those temps, the stirling engine can get 13.31% efficiency (  Ideal Stirling Cycle Calculator  ). The Lorenz coefficient of performance (Lorenz COP) of the heat pump is listed as 10.49. 10.49 times 0.1331 gives 139% efficiency meaning the stirling engine supplies more than enough mechanical power to turn the heat pump’s compressor. As long as heat transferred from the environment maintains the milk at 68F, the machine can continue to operate.",2021,7,4
Why would you do this when you can get the same power from a couple of solar panels?,2021,7,5
"If your input & output temperatures are the same, there's no power output to be had by a purely thermal process. In effect you're saying ""I can put some seawater into a sealed box with perfectly insulated walls (no heat flow through them) along with some air at the same 68C, add my gadget inside and run a couple of wires through the wall, and get power out of those wires forever, and free (we'll assume the gadget lasts forever.)"" This is impossible, it's a Perpetual Motion M/c of the First Kind & is impossible. Period. Go check your calcs properly, there's a flaw somewhere. 
 
However, you may be able to turn it into a PMM of the 2nd kind by opening up that sealed box to allow airflow at 68C through it. You can generate some power by building the rubber-band-on-an-LP-disc machine. This interesting toy rotates forever, it has an LP disc as the rotor and there's a small offset crankshaft through the middle. Lots of identical rubber bands are attached to the crank, so as the LP rotates in a vertical plane, these bands get stretched/shortened by about 1 or 2 cm. 
 
This LP on its own will sit stationary in equilibrium, no power comes out. 
 
You then arrange a bowl of water and let the bottom bands pass through this water. then let the LP rotate. Bands exitting the water are wet, and the water evaporates so lowering their temperature. These contract (or is it expand? I forget), and it's this contraction force that provides an imbalance to the torques on the crank & LP, and the LP rotates slowly. And of course there are many other ways you can use the evaporation of water to generate work out. In effect you're powered by the sun. Nothing new there. Yout problem is making it financially viable, and don't think that others haven't already considered this method. They have. 
 
See here for variants on this theme.  Fake perpetual motion machines you can build.",2021,7,5

The results of the first study indicated a substantial imbalance in the gender demographics, where the results indicated that EV users were 95% male, which may not have been representative of female EV usage, or the fact that buying an EV may have been a joint decision between a couple.

The only time i actually knew it was doing something was when a sensor failed causing the DPF regen to STOP happening, bringing up lots of nice warning lights. After fixing the sensor i went out onto the motorway with a laptop and force started a regen to get it all back working again, and you saw the soot values drop right down. 
From what diagnostics i did, it seemed to run a regen every 200miles or so. My commute is 30+ miles of motorway in each direction though, so perfectly suited to a diesel DPF system doing its thing.

"TBH i think variable servicing is fine. If the things barely getting warm and spending its life doing the school run, the oil probably does want changed after 6k. If its sat on a motorway as a repmobile, then 20k is also probably fine. Older service schedules used to be ""10k or 1 year"", which makes sense, if the car hasnt reached 10k in a year, its probably doing lots of short trips with increased oil wear as a result. 
 
The problem in my eyes seems to be that the manufacturers dont have the balls to simply tell it like it is. If you buy a diesel, and do short journeys, your going to reduce the oil life and potentially run into reliability issues as the system simply isnt intended for that use. Ofcourse, they're all playing the same tune and no-one wants to stick their neck out as it will lose business. 
 
It would seem whoever programmed that Jag/LR ECU actually did it properly, and the cars really did need their oil changed, untill the marketing types got involved and forced a change which very likely caused more issues, just over a longer term (likely out of warranty and beyond the first owner), due to the engine running for prolonged periods with over-dilute oil. 
 
I also believe almost all passenger car systems just use the main engine injection system to do the enrichment required for regens. Seperate systems arent seen much outside of commercial HGV type engines. Under normal running its not usually an issue.  
 
Where it causes problems is when the ECU wants to regen, but certain criteria arent met. For instance a common one is the coolant temp needs to be above 75c. So it ends up in a cycle, where EVERY time it gets driven, the engines just about at operating temp, it fires up a regen cycle, and then the person arrives home and shuts it off. The simplest answer would be to stick a light on the dash ""I'm currently doing a regen, do not turn me off"" or ""I need a regen, go take a leisurely 10minute drive round the bypass"" but again, nope, they seem to prefer to ignore the issue, and hope that most people do happen to do a longer trip often enough that the ECU can muddle thru.",2018,12,8

"Yes, you're right of course, but that doesn't mean a 60kWh EV won't manage better than today's EVs, so maybe they'll manage 5.5 - 6 miles per kWh making even 300 miles range easily a possibility (6 x 60 = 360) Even at 5 miles per kWh the range could be 300 miles and current EVs can better 5 miles per kWh, so if my Leaf had a 60kWh battery (say 58kWh usable now I reckon I could drive it almost 300 miles (5.2 x 58 = 301.6) I sometimes get 150 on the GOM now and have driven it well over 110 miles without recharging, in fact barely stopping! Yes, less in winter at high speed but that isn't my normal driving. 
Another point to bear in mind is that today's EVs are at the evolutionary stage my 100E was when new. But nothing could beat its best time between Chigwell and Bromley (20 miles in 20 minutes though the Blackwall Tunnel circa 1970. You'd be pushed to do it in under an hour today!)",2016,8,14

"Hi, 
 
I've been reading over several sections of this forum in recent weeks - picking up some really useful information. 
 
I currently drive a 64-Plate 1.4 Leon FR. I've had this car 18-months but have never really ""fallen"" for it. Historically I've had what some would describe as fun / ""drivers"" cars - a 500hp Nissan Skyline, mk5 Golf GTI, 2.5l Focus ST as examples. However, I couple of years ago I decided to get a bit more sensible - and found myself looking at SEATs - and ended up with the FR. It's a nice car - I get good MPG from it and it can be fun every now and then, but I've never really connected with it. As such I've been looking at replacing it and the more I've thought about it, and the more I've considered my day-to-day use of the car, I've realised/decided that an EV is a viable next step. 
 
My commute to work is only around 5miles each way - I used to cycle regularly to work. Over recent years the cycling has curtailed (just undertaken at the gym) and is partly why I bought the more sensible SEAT. I also rarely do any long journeys (20 to 40 miles at the weekends maybe, but rarely much more). So I really do think an EV will fit my lifestyle well. 
 
I'm only in the market for a used EV - and I'm not 100% sure on budget yet (I would guess maxing around £15k to £17k). 
 
I started off looking at the 94ah i3 BEV's and then thought it might not quite be practical enough. So expanded my interests to the 40kwh Leaf. Then considering budget and the possibility of spending a bit less I also start looking at the 30kwh Leaf. Reading this forum has opened my eyes to the 30kwh Soul EV and (pushing the budget) the Ionic 28kwh. 
 
I'm a bit unsure what way to go. I've yet to sample an EV so I need to try each as soon as I can, however performance across my list is varying considerably. I've no doubt that you'll advise me to ""ignore"" 0-to-60 times due to the max' torque available from an EV immediately, but 11+ seconds for some makes me think I might be uninspired (however I gather the 0-to-30 and 0-to-40 is impressive in most instances). That said, most of my driving is in town traffic so ultimate performance is not a ""deal breaker"" as such. It would be nice to have some fun now and then though... 
 
I only cover around 100 to 120 miles per week, so most of these will fit my range requirements with a little charging in the week (all the local supermarkets are close by and have chargers and I will look at a home install at the earliest opportunity). 
 
I do have a slight concern about home charging - as my mains comes in the front of my house and I park the opposite side of the house (a terrace). I do have a non-powered garage and the car could be parked in there, however currently I park in front of that. So having a home charger installed means running a power feed across the house (I'm guessing it would run from the front of the house up to the loft, across that and then back down the back of the house to the charger). 
 
Android Auto has become more important to me. My SEAT has an older version for the Infotainment and as such cannot have Android Auto. SEAT charge what I think is a rip-off for a new Map/SD Card - and I gather the map is still likely to be 1+ year(s) out of date. So I want to ensure Android Auto is available so that map data is less of an issue. I also do not believe any in-built mapping gets close to Google Maps/Waze/etc. 
 
I'll continue browsing the forum to pick up useful info - hopefully I can get to some dealers to have a closer look at some of the cars on my list to help me decide in which direction to go.

"Thanks for the replies. An old friend of mine (who I've not seen for a long time now sadly) has had 3 i3's (60, 94 and now a 120) and loves it. It's his city car as he has another ""play thing"", however, he can't speak highly enough of the i3 - which is what got me interested in them. 
 
They were my first option and I might be able to get away with it just about (practicality wise). It would be my only car but at a push I might be able to make the limited boot space work for me. 
 
""ultimate"" performance is not the be-all and end-all that it once was for me. I'd like something that ""feels"" fun but most day-to-day driving will be stuck in slow moving traffic or in 30/40 mph areas. 
 
I do have some concerns regarding buying at a time when the tech' is moving on so fast. Even the cars I'm looking at - particularly the ranges, they have been significantly improved upon by the latest cars (just comparing the SOUL 30kwh to the 64kwh for example). I wonder how much interest there will be in the 30/40 kwh cars in 2 or 3 years. This is where I started thinking maybe get something like a 30kwh Leaf and run that for 2 years and then move on to something that is newer (such as an ID.3). I'm a bit unsure where to go at the moment - and I think some of that is lack of knowledge with the cars in my price range and knowing the market.",2021,4,6
"Driving feel and a sense of fun without necessarily going too quickly...it has to be the i3 IMO, given the budget and all the available alternatives. Especially if there are any roundabouts on 40-50mph limit roads where you drive, the i3 is a lot of fun and can feel pretty quick. I also think the i3 will always be quite desirable as a used buy, even as technology advances. 
I had a lightly tuned mk5 GTI a while back now, and the i3 was probably just as much fun.",2021,4,6

Interestingly, I've stumbled across a Soul EV - 66 plate, with just shy of 48k miles on it for around £11,000. Mileage doesn't worry me too much - as my use will soon bring that down to something more reasonable. I kept thinking I'd only find a LEAF around that price bracket, but it's got me thinking. It'd potentially keep me going for a couple of years until the used market has matured a bit more and there are some more interesting options becoming available.

"Don't forget in your costings that the EV will cost little to run. Insurance likely to be the same but no road licence costs and very little for servicing. The MGs have 7 year warranty and there may be a few in your budget. The ZS will be fun to drive if you drive it quickly ... the rear suspension is a bit soft... but really you need to drive a few. The simplicity of the auto with no gears and silence makes a nonsense of noisy sports cars. Fast and tranquil milk floats or dodgem cars with brakes, you decide. And as for charging, given your mileage you might just be happy relying on a 3 pin socket with a decent extension lead for a while. I hope you join the club its the only way forward. 
You might like to look at James of James and Kate on Youtube who has just done some servicing in Scotland.. they have some VLOGs on test drives too. They own a MG ZS EV and a Tesla I believe... also Tesla Bjorn gives some interesting views on EVs on Youtube. He had a lot of input in the software changes they made to the ZS EV.",2021,4,9
"Yeah, James and Kate I've looked at loads of their reviews recently. I also have watched a lot of Bjorns videos. in-fact I've been trawling YouTube for information on lots of channels. 
 
I'm actually finding myself drawn more and more to the Soul EV (the 33kwh model). It looks like I should be able to find something in my budget and they appear to have a LOT of tech' as standard - which appeals massively. 
 
I think it's a toss-up between the i3 and the Soul EV - one being more fun to drive, the other loaded with tech and very efficient battery usage.",2021,4,12
"I'm curious to know, out of us on here, who only has an EV? Is it your family car? Toddlers? older kids? Or is the EV your second car? 
 
I'd be curious to know why, and how it works for you in the comments below. 
 
We just have one e-niro 64kwh - no other vehicles. We were a bit apprehensive at first - but so far it does everything we need - after a boot space mod.....and we will need a roof rack to do anything like camping or bike rides. 
 
And that's with two younger kids - preschool and school age, so whilst their bikes are small, they don't fit in the boot like they did with previous estate cars. 
 
I think this car, with boot mod and roof bars, will do 99% of what we need, and with far more ease than our previous diesels. The main exception will be our once-a-year 800mile round trip from North Yorkshire to Cornwall for a week. With only the odd short journey at the destination (<100 miles total) we could do it without refuelling at all in our previous car. This the drive could coincide with the children's sleeps very effectively. I've not even began to work out how I could do it. Our usual camp site does now have two 7kw chargers on site, so if we could bag one for the first night, it would have a huge difference on stress levels for working out how to get around and back!",2021,7,19

"A few months before my daughter was born I saw a father at the side of the road, rain pouring down, bonnet up with smoke everywhere and a crying child in the back. My soon-to-be dad brain kicked in and I decided I needed to get rid of my 11 year old Skoda Fabia. 
 
We didn't start out looking for an EV, but my wife prefers driving an automatic and when we looked at the price of a new ICE automatic vs Electric there didn't seem a lot of difference. 
 
We ended up getting a Zoe ZE40 on a 3 year lease and loved every minute of driving it. However, as my family grows so must the car. We just picked up an Enyaq iV60 last month and it's fantastic. Comfort, space, range etc are all as we need or better. I might even keep this one for good!",2021,7,19

All things we do or have done that are a slight inconvenience but when you balance them against what we “take” greedily from the planet every day then it’s small beer.

Would consider an electric motorcycle eventually but it'd need a similar range & charge speed to be able to ride with friends fossil bikes so a few years away from that. 
Used to take the motorcycle instead of the car during the summer as the motorcycle does 80mpg, but now I'm using the car much more as sitting in traffic in an EV isn't a major pollution event. If the roads do get too busy of course I'll switch to the motorcycle and filter.

Car is leased. When you subtract the figure we used to spend weekly on petrol the car costs us roughly £25-30 without factoring in cheaper servicing, no London Congestion charge etc. As everyone says the pinch point is going to come when the amount of EVs outstrips the amount of on-street and motorway chargers.

Not that I would undersell that more planning is needed for the longer trips for charging etc, it has been a really easy transition for us. We always said that for a really long trip we would just hire an ICE. Once you decide that, any range worries fade away - who really needs a car that can do 500miles on one tank?",2021,7,20

Nobody's time is precious enough so as to justify a completely avoidable quantity of CO2 emissions. I recently made an 850 km trip in one day and arrived completely relaxed at my destination in spite of the teething problems of a charging network that is literally getting better by the day.

We have 3 grown up kids and the 2 who live locally have 3 kids between them and we do lots of childcare! My wife’s elderly parents also live nearby and we often take them out too. 
 
Zoe gets used whenever possible but if we need to transport 5 (or more) people Zoe obviously isn’t big enough. Having said that ICE has only done 6000 miles in 2 years. ZE50 has done nearly that in 1 year and ZE40 did about 10k in 18 months. Pandemic has reduced overall mileage considerably. 
Last year we bought our first caravan so ICE is the tow car. Last year also saw a life change as pandemic caused me to retire a bit earlier than expected. In theory we could manage with 1 car. I don’t want to give up EV but not many EV’s currently can tow 1300kg caravan - and those that can are rather pricey! Actively looking at suitable towing EV’s but likely to wait until next year.

"Our only car is a Zoe through Onto. It’s just the two of us (both in our 30s) and my fiancée hasn’t driven in decades; she’s going to get refresher lessons at some point. 
 
No children yet but we often take friends with us since most of them don’t have a car, which is common enough in London - in fact we’ve done without one ourselves for as long as we’ve lived here (6 and 11 years), renting ICEs once or twice a year for road trips… I wasn’t really comfortable with that anymore, and anyway an entire month’s all-inclusive subscription with Onto was about the same cost as a few days with a Getaround car, factoring the fuel in, so it was a no brainer to get a Zoe for a week’s holiday at the beginning of May. 
 
We immediately loved it so much that I soon started looking at buying/leasing one - we’ll be moving to a house with a driveway (and roof space for solar panels  ) soon, but in the meantime we’ve renewed the subscription three times already. I might keep doing that while waiting for my employer to decide whether to set up a salary sacrifice scheme, and/or for VAG to finally offer the ID.3 with a vegan steering wheel as promised  , or for Kia to either do the same with the e-Niro or to start producing smaller cars on their new modular platform (the EV6 is amazing but also huge/expensive). 
 
Our mileage is very low most of the time since we both work from home, but that initial long road trip (around 1,400 miles) and occasional weekend trips are making sure we’re getting our money’s worth. Had almost no problem charging on the public network any time I needed to, but the game changer has been discovering the Shell Recharge network includes  char.gy, and that to use the two lamppost chargers on our road I just needed to add the card provided by Onto to the Shell Recharge app (and check that it’s all renewable energy  ).

"For this forum - it's kind of bad for EV+Rex/hybrid but in reality it's a money grab from mid/low price mid/low emission ICEs. Take a look at the NGC webpage on the subject - the fiat 500 and fiesta suddenly are ~£400 more over the first 3 years and £140 every year after. Maybe this doesn't seem much on a by-week basis but it's 3% of the asking price (based on carwow at the mo) after 3 years and way over 6% after 6.... and is sneaked in a year after purchase so the poor ol' stupid proletariat won't notice. 
 
It's not really cheaper for all affluent folks either- check out the extra cost on some cars at the luxury end of things. You're going to have to check the original vehicle list-price before buying it or you could be in for a nasty surprise. 
 
 2017 car tax rates - changes to new VED rates explained 
 Car tax changes will see seven out of 10 drivers pay more | Next Green Car  
 
Anyone thinking of buying a cheap low emission ICE should be much more offended by this that the EV community; however, if you're going to buy a new ReX buy it now. If you're going to buy a 1 year old used Rex you've got about 15 months to get on with it. One assumes it's not great for the new PHEVS being released at the mo - over 40K at least (the top end Outlander is iirc). 
 
I'd originally wondered if it was a nasty short term trick by George Osbourne to make his 2017-2019 figures look good for re-election (as PM) in 2020 (most of the VED is front-loaded on medium emissions vehicles & any savings are later). One way or another it turns out a year is a very very long time in politics. Tee hee. Hard luck Osbo old fruit. 
 
 Keeping pure EV free (sub £40000) is a good move and surely something to be applauded longer term by this community?  After that it's just down to range and charging infrastructure.... range is getting there over the next 4-5 years, infrastructure... well, other folks have posted about that.

Think that's the term.Goverment taxing needs a rethink along with the whole charging  infrastructure.We want to go electric,Yes to save on fuel costs but all so to go green it did seem to make  sense.Tax only ever goes  UP.May we'll wait 12 months to see if the 200 mile EV lands on our  shores.We are defanatly having a rethink.",2017,1,16
"I believe wear & tear on roads goes up as a cube of the weight applied. So VED arguably should be proportional to (((VehicleWeight/NumberOfTyres) cubed) x NumberOfTyres).

The only downside is the low front, which routinely scrapes going in and out of driveways. I can see why this is the best selling used EV right now.

"There are a few that have been brought over from the states to Italy. A car sharing scheme in Turin (I think) has a few. 
 
The high cost of import is less of an issue here as used car prices are so much higher. While you can pick up an early leaf for £7k in Britain, it would cost me €5k just to get a 1990 Fiat Panda Elettra with 2 seats, lead batteries and a range of 35km. 
 
On a wider note, thinking about Fiat and electric vehicles, you have to consider that Fiat sell over half of their annual European production in Italy, so unless something works in Italy they are unlikely to do it. Here are a couple of the reasons why the spread of electric cars in Italy is going to be difficult without some changes at a national level. Firstly, power limits. In Italy we can't just use as much power as our main fuse can take at any moment and be charged for it, we have to choose a limit (3kW, 4.5 kW, or 6kW) and the standing charge jumps for those requesting a higher limit. From this you'll see that having a domestic 6.6kW charger is not possible as you are already over the highest limit, so you are left with 3.3kW, which is unattractive to many. Secondly, electricity prices are much higher here than other parts of Europe. It would cost me €8 to charge a 24kWh battery from 0 - 100%, and that is more than it costs for the equivalent distance worth of petrol in our Punto. So, unless you really want to, and there are some (but not many) people that do want to, there is no economic case for the switch yet, and until there is then people won't switch and Fiat won't spend money building cars that they can't sell at home regardless of the views of their boss.",2017,10,18
"If electricity prices are so high in Sicily then that is where the problem lies, and is where the people should be focussed on forcing change. That is, of course, unless someone is being made 'an offer they can't refuse', to keep things as they are.  
 
In a place with a great sunshine record the answer could be for everyone to install PV. Payback times would be short due to the mains price. Coupled with home battery storage then local EV transport would be very economical.",2017,10,18
You make some good points but I don't want to turn the thread into a discussion about Italian politics. I was just trying to point out that Fiat's lack of enthusiasm is due to more than Marchionne.,2017,10,18
"Hopefully when Mercedes starts competing in Formula E, Ferrari will have a change of heart and go head to toe with them in the 2019/20 season. Then maybe the 500e will finally have its day in the sun and Italy will change its opinion of EV's and all the necessary incentives to get them accepted... ",2017,10,18
"If you are thinking of importing one, I'd first have a word with your local Fiat garage. 
You don't want to get it, and go there with a problem and they say there's no way they are looking at it, as they don't have any manuals, diagrams tools etc, training , for the HV system.....  
 
But I too wish they'd sell one in the UK as a Zoe / eUp rival .... I'm sure it would go down well in the Nordics and low countries.",2017,10,20
"You can add me to the list of 500 owners who would've happily traded in their 500 for an ""e"" here in the UK! I have owned nothing but FIATs and Alfas all my life.

Its great to hear that they are still going strong after 3 yrs too. Bodes well.

"They made sense to tempt people into EV's 10 years ago, but serve no purpose now as EV's have improved. I know Toyota's argument is with limited battery supply more hybrids can be built than full EV's but again that argument fails with the massive increase in the plans companies are making to produce more batteries. At the end of the day your increasing cost and complexity for little benefit compared to a modern EV and once the battery has been depleted on longer journeys your hauling dead weight.",2021,4,22

"Got collared by a neighbour earlier this week. He knows I have driven EVs for a few years and wanted to pick my brains. I tried to be helpful and honest but was wasting my time really as he had already made up his mind that he wanted a Range Rover which he reckons will give him a 40 mile EV range and the flexibility to do long distances when he needs it.

Most people looking at PHEV Range Rovers and similar are doing so due to attractive BiK benefits rather than genuinely trying to reduce emissions.

"Linking the Range V8 owner somewhere above and my own experiences ... 
I met my wife when she had a Series II with a 3.5 V8 after market, and I had a from factory same lump in my 110 12seater.  
Now ? Fiat 500 and a BEV. I had a Prius and a Auris HSD before getting my feet properly into EV motoring with a Golf GTE.  
Why do I say properly ? - Mon-Fri the ICE never started - all commuting, short trips were done on electrons - including sitting at motorway speeds.  
Disconnected pre heating in frozen hotel car parks was brownie-point winning when the car was used by others on their business trips. Back home with me a total luxury, especially for 2am January callouts.  
Yes I had the luxury of charge points at the business park I worked at, although with PlugShare compulsory via landlord 2hr max signs we could get 4-5 vehicles through each of the 7 sockets per workday.  
Yes I had the luxury of supermarket PodPoints within 1.5miles of home, and the banks-other shops I needed to visit were within a easy walk away from there - so could easily be away from the car for 90mins. 
It was a company car but having given back the Full Hybrids the tax wasn't noticeable.  
 
To the often quoted point about long journeys ---- press the right buttons at the right times in this VAG product, and I could run it easily like a Prius --- so Cardiff > Portsmouth or centre of London (Fleet Street, the strand) were 55-58mpg easily. And, unleaded not diesel pump prices.  
And, this is the winner, NO CHARGER WORRIES  
 
Right now, I am dreading first full car long BEV trip, even though I have Plan B + C ready, it's the look of disapproval, the very loud sighs from the rest of the car when the charge point won't work, is in use, gives 37 instead of the 72 I was expecting etc etc and the plan of reaching journey end at X o Clock goes right out of the window. That might be a trip I only do every second month, but the Eye Glare burn-in will stay for ages. Despite this, I am glad I got the BEV, and it will be replaced with one too.

2024 - 40mpg+ 
2022 - 30mpg+

"I've been a diesel driver for years but have hankered after an EV for a few years, doing my research! A family member might want to buy my low mileage 2015 Dacia Duster diesel car, so I'm seriously pondering what to get now. Whilst I love my gadgets I also dig functionality over style, so what some might see as an ugly duckling, is not necessarily ruled out. 
 
If I kept the diesel as a second vehicle I've been seriously tempted by the Twizy as a fun run around but if I'm selling the diesel, I'll need a far more capable vehicle. My only issue is my driveway is barely the length of a car, there's no gate and it's a busy main road (Southampton's very own Piccadilly Circus), where school children walk past every day. This means any car parked on the driveway needs to be reversed on as reversing out into a busy road is a no-go. This also means any electric car cannot have a charge port on the nose, as the darling little feral, pint sized crotch goblins will snap the plug and charge flap whilst walking by, the moment I turn my back! 
 
So, I'm needing a short list of EVs which have  side accessed charging ports.  Budget £15-30k ish. Not that interested in PCP or finance unless I can get a discount then pay it off in full soon after, as I usually own a vehicle until it becomes a liability to keep repaired.

 VW ID.3 (do I really want to be a software beta tester for what might be Windows ME on Wheels??) 
 VW eUP and the VAG siblings (bit small, only 3kw charging on AC I seem to recall) 
 Skoda Enyaq 
 Smart For-Two / For-Four (excluded as they don't do DC rapid charge) 
  
Tesla, even 2nd hand sub 30k, are off my shortlist as I can't be doing with a company who are so anti right-to-repair and have questionable build quality.

"If you can fit some of these cars (on your list) by length, then I'm sure the last gen Kia Soul would also fit. The cover pops open sideways, not out, and the actual socket is far enough back that you don't really need that much clearance at the front. I could park with just 6 inches clearance and pop the cover, lean over to insert the plug. You can only lean from one direction though because that flap comes sideways and you need to do this from the other side, it is not central. 
 
I suspect other cars are likewise. You might be over-restricting your list because in fact the actual sockets are usually quite some distance back from the actual cover and the clearance needed is really a matter of inches. There's no need in most cases to be able to actually stand in front of the car to plug one in. YMMV. 
 
Pick the car you want and get a loaner to see if it fits your driveway, before writing it off.

Also it is simply not safe to reverse onto a busy main road, right next to a junction with a roundabout. Whilst it's a 30MPH zone, many cars are doing that by the time they come off the roundabout and pass my house, doing 40MPH or more a few more yards up the road!

"There's already a couple of threads about the tumble that used EV prices are going through at the moment, with different opinions about how bad it is. Well, in my case it's pretty bad, as my 10-month old Fiat 500 (RRP ~32k, I paid ~28k) is currently valued by dealerships / Motorway / Motorpoint / WBAC about 18-20k 😱 down from 26.5k just a couple of months ago. 
 
Of course I'll try to sell it privately, as there's a couple of identical ones on AutoTrader going for 26-28k, but who knows if I can actually get anywhere near that... 
 
The reason I'm looking to sell it is that my company has introduced a salary sacrifice scheme, but I could wait another year for that. It would probably cost me about £2k to rent a bigger car for the couple of occasions I'll need one in the meantime. 
 
Obviously it only makes sense if there's any hope for used values to go back up after the current storm (and the potential new one caused by loads of Model 3 coming off their leases in April, apparently) has passed. 
 
What does the hive mind think - should I risk waiting, or is it just wishful thinking anyway?",2023,2,13
"I think down. Everything will recover to realistic prices. It's been fairy-tale prices, and been fairy-tale prices for a long while, but I usually get these things wrong. I sold my Passat for a great price (from my POV) and it's market price has gone up further! The dealer who bought it added on £2k to the price I sold it, and it's currently on Autotrader as 'Great Price'. 
 
I mean, yeah, great if they sell it at that price, but I suspect it's suddenly become a tough market for selling cars.",2023,2,13

That's in one month. This is not a popular topic on this forum. Lots of heads on sand....,2023,2,13
"Car price depreciation is likely to be about 25% after 1 year, 50% after 3 years. My I3S was actually going up in value for the first 18 months I owned it so it doesnt suprise me that it has almost halved in the last couple of months. I's just returning to the long term average",2023,2,13
"I think we've already established that using WBAC as a price yardstick is way off reality. 
 
There are 3 reasons for big recent price drops: 
 
1. Correction in ridiculously high used prices which were exceeding new RRP. 
 
2. The Tesla price drop has caught a lot of used Tesla sellers out. They are likely to lose money on their current stock, and the market is waiting to see if other marques follow suit (unlikely). 
 
3. The cost of running an EV has shot up, especially for those charging away from home that aren't on a cheap overnight tariff. 
 
When we get cheap (ish) electricity back (~20p per kWh), EVs will be a lot more desirable again. Once the Tesla situation has stabilised and its clear other marques won't follow suit on price drops, everything will stabilise there too. These shock drops should stop happening. 
 
Also, don't forget - the first drop is the worst drop. Whether you sell a car 2 weeks or 18 months after buying it, the price you'll get won't vary too much. In every car price, there's the dealer's margin to build in. You'll never get more than 85% of what a dealership thinks they can sell it for. When a dealer can sell a 6 month old car for RRP because new cars have a long wait, you'll get 85% of that. When a dealer can sell a 2 year old car for 75% of RRP, you'll get 64% of RRP (85% of 75% of RRP) etc. Some cars will fare better than others, as their marques always have. 
 
The biggest hit to us here is that 2 years ago, we were used to getting at least 15% off the new car and that discounting is currently not happening.",2023,2,14
"Cars are not a sensible purchase, you buy what you want and once you get board like a spoiled child you get rid of it. They are overpriced toys and like most things loose value once purchased. 
 
it’s fun having a new car but it’s going to cost you money. Going out with a celebrity or having a cocaine habit or buying a yacht or an airplane are about as sensible as buying a new car. 
 
if you have the spare cash buy a car and enjoy using it but don’t buy something thinking there’s a profit to be made. It’s a consumer product not an investment. My rule of thumb over ten years is new cars average a loss purchase price of over 20% from purchase price plus insurance, running costs and fuel. 
 
We are consumers not investors wake up and smell the coffee. A new car takes it doesn’t give. You need to have at least £6000 of annual income after tax to waste each year to run cars under three years old.. that’s twelve hours of work a week on minimum wage just to own not run a car. 
 
they are expensive toys.",2023,2,14
"What exactly is the OP going to wait for? The used price going back up again? 
 
Next year your used car will be worth £18k if lucky and quite frankly this is normal. I did state last year that used EV prices were a joke and would fall but many on here thought it was the new norm. 
 
Used EV prices were high purely down to market forces. Long waits for new, chip shortages and then fuel prices drove up demand for EVs. Used car sellers saw a change to profiteer and bumped prices significantly. Used were more expensive than new and that was never going to last. 
 
So to answer the OP, you do whatever you want but expecting £26 - £28k for a 1 year old car that cost £33k new is not going to happen. And it won’t get better by waiting a year.",2023,2,14
In the past with ICE cars always bought at three years old for 50% of new price from a main dealer with all the trimmings. EVs have been even cheaper than that at times but expect them to be at parity with ICE cars now. That way no finance is required ,2023,2,14
"Also, try to remember that most of the time, we're comparing our ""purchase"" price, with our ""sale"" price - which has always meant that you lose the the original selling dealer profit the moment you sign for it. It shows actually just how ridiculous the prices did get - essentially cars were getting twice their profit back when sold to a dealer. I try to remember that I bought at £29K, and WBAC are offering £17K - but really I should be comparing the £17K with the probabe £24K that me dealer bought it for. Not much comfort knowing that though !! adds insult to injury. 
 
The good news I see is that the numbers of EVs currently up on BCA auctions are showing a trend of reducing - so supply might be drying up again. As to what that will do to prices when all the other factors come into play is anyones guess, but I suspect they'll stop dropping, and presumably in WBACs case might well go up again.",2023,2,14
"Theres definately been a correction due. Its long been a known ""fact"" about buying a new car that it loses thousands simply driving it off the forecourt. The only reason that precipitous initial drop has been absent over the last few years is due to demand for EVs (and all cars really) outstripping supply. It could obviously never continue indefinately. 
 
I think EV's will continue to be worth more than an equivalent ICE model, supply still plays a role there. As the new EV sales ramp up, demand for older models will also increase, but the supply of those is both limited and fixed, which should help maintain pricing. Just not to the silly levels we've seen recently with people thinking their 2 year old car is still worth the same as it was when new. Old LEAFs have remained stubbornly around 6k for the last 5-6 years for example. 
 
As a side note, if lots of dealers have gotten burned on their stock of EV's you can be sure they'll be much more cautious over the next few years on trade in values.",2023,2,14
"So, The deal has been done with SWIMBO. 
 
We have been toying with the idea of changing her Fiat 500 to a 24kw Leaf. We could sell her car and buy one outright. She doesn't like the look of the leaf so that gets shot down straight away, whereas it has grown on me! She only covers 5-7k per year. 
 
So I think the plan now is that I change my car in 3 years time to whatever EV I fancy at the time. My wife sells her car and pays off the remainder of the HP on the Soul. We have come to this conclusion because she loves driving my Soul, for all the same reasons we love it. From what I see on other forums and FB pages EV cars, in general, seem to be a lot more reliable due to the lack of moving parts compared to an ICE car. And TBH I too would love to see the Smurf stay in the family. Its quirky looks I love. So, for now, we are going to be holding onto the 500.",2017,8,27
"This also happened to me on Friday. I have Pasted it in from Our Irish EV FB page 
 
I will explain a few of the local nuances. My local town (Coleraine) has 2 X 22kw Duel head chargers. That's 4 spaces for our town. In Ireland, the whole network is run by a company called ESB. ESB have an app that is supposed to give ""live"" (every 15 mins) updates on charger status. On Friday unbeknown to me, the app was not working properly. All of the units in town showed as Free!! So I ran my errands and the story below unfolded.  
 
 So today it finally happened!!!  
 
I left home with 100% this morning drove to work and then had a few errands to do before heading home to Coleraine. I had to go into town for a few hours, which meant I could get a charge at either of the 2 SCP's in the town. I know I am going to be tight for battery left. I checked the esb app and both chargers are available. I check 3 times as I get past the no return point. I arrive at the first charger and it's got an ampera which blocks the charger every day during the week. And an outlander plugged in outlander is not charging and I believe the ampera to be full also. I then check the app again and it shows the other charger on the other side of town if free. I drive slowly over there only to find an i3 rex and outlander plugged into it grrrrr. Now I have burnt my bridges. I have 5% battery left with 7 miles left to get home. I had no option but to call a cab to get home. I will get my wife to run me back in later on and get a 20 min charge so I can get home......had the esb app been more accurate I'd have just gone straight home instead of burning battery on fool's errands.",2017,8,27
"All 4 are not 100% dependent on the ion's? You are.! 
EV ethics dictate they should leave their number in the screen , or be on chargebump you can give them a nudge if they are blocking. 
Personally, , I'd have unplugged the Ampera..",2017,8,28
The Ampera was there on Wednesday afternoon when we used the chargers there.,2017,8,28
"The only other place we've had issues is The Junction at Antrim, where we had to wait for two Leafs, another Leaf drove by and we had a fresh Leaf charging next to us with one waiting as we left the charge post.",2017,8,29
"I was listening to some women chatting in a cafe the other day, discussing their new car choices. All the usual phrases came up, discussing engine size, fuel type and MPG. Then as my family and I gawped at some Maseratis and Ferraris with their engines on show I thought about the engine size, performance and whatnot... all in ""traditional"" well established terms. 
 
Then I thought ask me the same about an i3, about a Model S, even about my LEAF... I've no idea how to explain. 
 
To help ""normalise"" EVs it seems to me that part of the progression should be that we know and speak about them on some kind of ""normal"" car level. But is this even possible? 
 
For example the ZOE has a 65 kW motor, the LEAF has a 80 kW motor, the BMW i3 has a 130 kW and the Model S has a 310 kW motor. That's how they seem to be described in most scenarios, maybe with a hp rating in brackets. 
 
I know they're electric, but is there a reason we're not more used to seeing and saying the ZOE has a 87 bhp motor, the BMW i3 a 174 bhp motor and the Tesla a whopping 416 bhp motor? 
 
I also find it hard to explain (as I don't really understand) why a Tesla motor produces 416 hp when a ZOE produces 87 hp. With a traditional car I know (more or less) what's going on and can explain that in terms which other drivers and car people will basically understand. But with electric drive... not so much. Is there an equivalent of valve numbers or engine block size we can translate or transcend into EV talk? 
 
Does anyone else here understand and appreciate what I mean and think I have a valid point? Can we educate each other to the extent we can make an EV sound more ""normal"" in day to day car conversations? 
 
 
",2014,8,12
"Why compare power ratings of EVs anyway? We don't compare vacuum cleaners or washing machines in those terms, but in how effective they are at fulfilling their roles.",2014,8,12
"A lot of the ICE appreciation chat is ill informed anyway. You rarely hear anyone mentioning max torque @ rpm whereas this is a big factor in the car feeling good in normal use. That's conditioned by the engine size, diesel or petrol, gear box set-up etc... 
 
So for example saying that the i3 has 168hp (very often quoted) and all the torque from the get go says a lot to me. Model S owners might find describing their cars acceleration being a bit like the Falcon Millennium's jump to hyperspace...",2014,8,12
I always say it's about £2.60 for every 100 miles. Most of my friends iv done over 100 miles in one go with them in the car so they know it's true but still don't like ev's. All my cars have been power full cars like a EVO4 RX7 so thing think iv gone insane lol.,2014,8,12
"I don't mind the change to kw. The ""litres"" for engines was starting to be meaningless (my GF's 0.6l turbo Fiat 500 is more powerful than the 1.2l non-turbo) and it's difficult to relate ""horsepower"" to anything, I have never measured the output of a horse... 
 
I guess you can start geeking out about the motor type (DC, AC, brushes or brushless, permenant magnet, hybrid) but power output is a constant and simple comparison. 
 
As for why the Model S motor is so much more powerful than the Zoe, yes, the motor is probably a little larger, but not massively so. The difference is in the inverter (the component which takes DC electrcity and makes it AC to feed the motor) which is much more powerful. That's the difference between the normal 85kw Model S and the Performance version, a more powerful inverter (+60hp in old money). The other important factors are the battery, a poor Leaf battery is cranking out close to 4C at full power, they couldn't push out the ~13C needed to power a Model S P85. The other consideration of course is that even if you could persuade the Leaf cells to give that much power, and the inverter was up to the job, you would empty the battery VERY quickly, as in less than 5minutes!!",2014,8,12
"Someone asked me what the mpg was recently ...  
 
In the US they have MPG-e but there doesn't seem to be an EU equivalent yet.",2014,8,13
"And as US and UK gallon are different, I guess we can't directly translate. On that front I don't think it really matters. I tend to say that if I charged solely at home 10k miles would cost in the region of £350 in fuel. That's roughly accurate and really makes people understand the basics of that side of things.",2014,8,13
"I like the idea of a Model S being designated as being Torque Factor Nine and all other ev having comparative figures. 
In stating acceleration we should have both 0-60 and 0-30 figures because for me on our crowded 0-30 is the telling one. 
One thing potential ev owners will want to discuss is speed of charging at home and away. X miles/minute? 
 
I wonder what one-upmanship terminology rival Volkswagen salesmen use to describe their vehicles?",2014,8,16
"I suppose we could keep things in best petrolhead terms and talk about horsepower output to keep things on the same comparative level..but the way EV's lay down the power,the pickup from zero is going to be faster than an ICE at the lights..apples and oranges..",2014,8,16
"Yeah, a 0-30 makes a lot more sense for a city car.",2014,8,16

"This looks very cool, and is promised to come in cheaper than the 500e.",2022,1,18
"Will it be less expensive than a Dacia Spring?  
Even if it isn't the market could use a step up from the Spring. There isn't much choice for small basic EVs as the moment.  
 
Especially in the UK where we've got a Citoen Ami and nothing else at the moment. Twizy is gone from the Renault GB website. Both are low speed quadracycles.  
 
Skoda Citigo and Seat Mii are out of production. VW eUP! order book is closed although there are some new ones available. Unclear when (if?) any of these will return to the UK.",2022,1,18
"Fiat 500e is being offered new at around the £21k-£22k mark. 
 
So it would be cool if the electric Panda (you heard it here first) came in under £20k.",2022,1,18
"It looks really promising. The Panda has always been good but the Up/Citigo/Mii felt like the sort of thing that Fiat used to be great at - cheap but fun, robust and space-efficient. Love the modular parts and that concept of just clipping your phone to the side of the instrument cluster. 
 
My first few cars were Fiats and I really hope they get their m-o-j-o back under Stellantis. 
 
(edit: is m-o-j-o blocked as a swear word? odd)",2022,1,18
"I do like the notion of bring- your -own infotainment system. If they can make it work with any smartphone or tablet they have a winner!

Mussolini’s was the Topolino:,2022,1,18
"At least Pierre Boulanger, the forces behind the Tres Petite Voiture (aka 2CV) was only Vice Chairman of Michelin and worked against Petin and the Vichy regime during the occupation of France in WW2. Still not sure about the reported design brief of : 
 
create a car that can carry four people and 50 kg of potatoes at 60 km/h, while consuming just 3 litres of fuel per 100 km... it should be drivable by a woman or by a learner-driver ... and don't worry about how it looks 
 
It was a long time before ""3 litre"" (93 MPG) cars became a reality.",2022,1,18
"I love the Panda. We still have a 15 year old 100hp. I would love a Panda EV, and I really hope (but sadly doubt) that they’ll make a 100hp equivalent with sharp handling and a bit more oomph. The combination of size, practicality and fun would be hard to beat.",2022,1,18
"Yes the original ""people's car"" was the VW. 
But when they resurrected the beetle they turned it more into a lifestyle/upmarket fashion accessory with a price to match, and it wasn't exactly the runaway success of the original. 
Not even made now after a short run.  
The Panda is, and always was, affordable. 
And the articles hint that will still be the case. 
Fiat aren't stupid, they know who will buy it. 
Been saying for ages electric cars need to be small and affordable- Renault can't be bothered to offer the electric Twingo or Dacia the Spring in the UK, absolute fools not to. 
I would buy either in a heartbeat, hoping the electric Panda will make it here next year.",2022,1,18
"At least it might be EV from the ground up. 
How old is a 500 now?- came out in 08 so they fudged an EV out of a 14 year old platform.",2022,1,18
"NEW 500. 
Well that's about time lol. 
Maybe they'll use the current 500 motors in the new Panda (smaller car, if that's possible). and develop new (bigger ones) for the new 500. 
Although there looks to be a Panda and a grande version ( although probably a normal sized Panda with plastic cladding). 
Whatever, looking forward to seeing what Fiat have in store- hoping we'll even get a small Alfa with a pokey motor, now that would be interesting.",2022,1,18
"I'd be very surprised at a 200 mile winter range. That requires efficiency witchcraft of the EQXX variety or at least a 50kWh battery. I can't see this taking the Zoe's small car range crown. It just needs to be less basic and have a more commuter friendly top speed than the Spring, at the right price. My guess is a 40kWh battery, maybe as small as 30kWh. It's whether they option it with something bigger at a sensible price.",2022,1,18
"Pandas are amazing little cars: five of us driving from Torino to an agriturismo up a road which became covered in snow as we climbed. No problem and tremendous fun, and not the 4WD version either. I've just checked the maps: my Italian friend would need a range of 90 winter miles for a regular trip she does so I can't see her getting one, but don't assume people use them purely as city cars in Italy.",2022,1,18
"Sounds brilliant and I love the shape proposed and modular concept. 
 
We had a panda (and a cinquecento sporting) for years and loved them,so much character.",2022,1,19
"I actually kinda like the simplicity of this. I quite like the idea of stripping out all the unnecessary tech that gets jammed into cars nowadays that does nothing but make it expensive, and replacing it with the same phone I use for the other 23 hours a day. 
 
I'll be interested to see the battery size and the boot! 
 
I might even be tempted to give up the remote climate control from my Leaf if this turns out to be a good car, with good range, a battery that will last well, nice fast CCS charging and sensible luggage capacity 🤔 Ultimately I'd be delighted to just have my Leaf but with CCS and a bigger battery, but it doesn't seem like anyone's going to make that for a sensible price anymore.",2022,1,19
"Problem is that the current safety led systems are adding significantly to the price of seemingly all UK delivered cars - airbags everywhere, EBD, ESP, LDW, ACC, Blind Spot/Rear crossing warning etc. The FIAT Panda had little if any of these systems (depending on the age that we are harking back to) and it'll be interesting to see if these are stripped out to get down to a price - they clearly cannot be replaced with a mobile phone App. 
Speaking personally, I'd be happy without them but accept that I'm different to the majority.",2022,1,19
"Probably all about ncap ratings and EU regs. 
Some of which have little or no impact on saving your life-TPMS? 
Yes I want my car to give me some protection but I really don't want stuff that adds significantly to the price that work away away in the background and cost a fortune to fix when they inevitably go wrong out of warranty. 
Simple, basic, a-b motoring is all I want.",2022,1,19
"It's a remarkable piece of how marketing can manipulate people. 
 
All these reminiscences over past Pandas. 
 
Do you folk really think this new Panda EV will share even a single switch with the old Pandas you know? 
 
The only thing they have in common is the name. 
 
It's like going aboard the Russians' 'Atomflot' nuclear powered ice breaker '[50 years of] Victory' and saying 'ah, yes, it's just like I remember seeing Nelson's 'Victory' in Portsmouth'. 
 
.. The power of advertising!   .....",2022,1,19
"Indeed, the Panda has always been designed as a compact, cheap, simple and therefore reliable car for people who just want a car. The joy of simplicity!",2022,1,19
"On the plus side, making all these safety systems compulsory will drive down the cost and increase the reliability - eventually. 
 
But to put it all jn perspective, the top of the range Panda (100hp like ours) was priced at £9995 when it went off sale in 2010. It had climate control, ABS, traction control, and two airbags, which was a fair bit more than the minimum legal requirement. However paired down the EV Panda is, it’s unlikely that the base model will retail for less than twice the cost.",2022,1,19

"I had a Panda 100HP about ten years ago. Loved driving it, but always felt that something expensive could go wrong with the mechanics. And I don't think it got much past six years of life. 
 
Would love to see an electric Panda. Guess they could base it on the same platform as the Corsa and 208 if the 500 platform isn't used. Give it the classic tall back end and stick as little possible past the wheels at each end. 
 
Can't see it going for much under 20k, but would be great to see that barrier broken - shame the Dacia won't be crossing the channel.",2022,5,4
Basically seems like a Fiat eUP with similar specs at around or slightly less cost. Sounds good to me.,2022,5,4
Anyone seen any updates on this? Contemplating seat mii replacement.,2022,9,17

Would keep the Seat if it could charge quicker.",2022,9,17
So true. We need smaller and cheaper long range BEVs that have clever designs. Like this recently mentioned here;  https://www . nissan - global.com/EN/INNOVATION/DESIGN/DESIGNWORKS/SAKURA/,2022,9,17
"ID1 and Seat clone coming but God only knows when, can't see those being sub 20k either. 
Read about a little Hyundai EV that looks similar in size and shape to the Suzuki Ignis, again will ot make to production/UK shores? 
I still say Dacia are nuts not to bring the Spring over here.",2022,9,17
"The PSA Peugeot / Citroen forum is incorrectly titled and poorly organised. 
 
With your help, we'd like to fix that. 
 
Stellantis brands are Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, RAM, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. 
 
Stellantis are rapidly becoming a major BEV manufacturer. Fiat will be an EV only brand in Europe by 2026. That is full BEVs, not hybrids. 
 
 
 
I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum. That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer  passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out.

The automatic and manual versions of any car i've ever been in have used the same handbrake activation mechanism. Older stuff used a lever behind the shifter. More modern stuff in the last 5 or 10 years have moved towards buttons/switches and electrical activation instead. 
 
I imagine if you've never seen an auto with a normal handbrake, you've simply never driven one thats old enough to still have a normal handbrake.",2017,7,30
"The EU/US thing and age make sense. The only old automatic cars I've driven were american, and had foot activated parking brakes.

In gold I think I would be reminded of C3PO with those headlights! 
 
Finally great to see Honda getting close to bringing an EV though as I have brand loyalty to them. The new CRV hybrid sounds like a clever system with the engine powering the electric motor to drive the wheels at urban speeds in EV and hybrid modes. What a shame they didn’t put more than a 1kWh battery in. This could have been a bit like an Ampera if there was a plug and larger battery. Nevertheless it sounds like it’s a better system than that in the RAV4 hybrid in terms of how often the motor provides drive and in real mpg, which sounds like it will manage into the 50’s rather than the mid 40’s of the RAV.",2018,11,24

"Iv had my Kona for 9 months now after I wrote off my previous car a hyundai Ioniq that I’d payed £12000 for. 
To cut a fairly long story short my insurance company informed me that they valued my Ioniq at £15000 but could only pay me out with £11000 as that was the figure quoted as the vehicle’s estimated value on the policy. 
Obviously I had the hump but had to except the offer but as an interim payment to put down on a new vehicle. 
I immediately contacted the insurance ombudsman and last week received their findings. 
The ombudsman agreed to side with me and has ordered my insurance company to pay another 4300 and £100 compensation as well as 8% interest. 
Let’s just say I’m rather satisfied to just be on the winning team on this one

"This is brilliant news! 
I love taking on companies and as I've gotten older I've started to see it as a blood sport nowadays. 
My ex once ordered a Fiat 500 but due to the long delays cancelled and ordered a Peugeot 207 from the same multi brand dealer. 
I asked specifically if it had curtain air bags as ESP wasn't available to order and I wouldn't have a car without curtain airbags at the least, they had an advert saying it did but I was sure it didn't. The dealer said it definitely came with curtain airbags. 
 
When we went to collect the 207 my ex instantly regretted not waiting for the 500. So having a look around the car before signing the paperwork I noticed it didn't have curtain airbags and told my ex I'd get us out of it. So I went and spoke to the manager and said we were rejecting the car as it wasn't as described. He said that they'd install the curtain airbags for us (I'm not even sure it would be possible) and I refused and said point blank we weren't taking delivery of the car. 
He ended up getting irate and I matched it because I knew I was right and he couldn't stop me. He tried the strong arm tactics of saying we wouldn't get our part exchange back and if we cancelled we couldn't get our 500 order back and would have to reorder and wait all over again. 
Suffice to say I got our part exchange back and also kept our order and build slot for the 500 😁",2022,12,6

"I too am waiting for an efficient small and sensibly priced hatchback. 
I got rid of my old MG ZS as was too big for my driveway, looked everywhere for something that gets similar miles, smaller (length was our issue), well spec'd and sensibly priced (Ie, notably less than what I bough the MG for). 
Nothing. 
 
I'm in a dino juice Ignis at the moment until I find something that suits - if they ever do an Ignis EV or similar I'll be all over it as it's the perfect size for my daughter and I now that she's out of a buggy and I can practically sling it diagonally across the drive with not a single care. 
 
Seems like if you don't like/want jacked up crossovers and huge hatchbacks then your options are HondaE($$$), Zoe(0*) or Eup.  
 
As far as OPs question I imagine the Peugeot E208 or similar? Not sure about 1 pedal because I thought that was Nissans 'party trick'? But it's shorter and narrower while still seating 5 according to reviews?",2023,1,9
"If narrowness is an absolute priority in an EV that's still a 5 door and 4 seater, you'll be hard pressed to find something narrower than a Peugeot Ion / Citroen C-Zero / i-Miev, (all basically the same car) it's truly comical how narrow they are.   
 
When I owned one I always said it ""made every car park into a parent and child space"", and it really did. 
 
Here is my one (now two years sold) next to a Hyundai Tucson, which is probably about the same width as a Leaf:",2023,1,9
"Bring on the id1/panda/108 electric.

MG4 is wider. 
 
There's only the Zoe, stellantis Corsa/e208s/fiat 500 etc. Plus Honda E. Stellantis don't do one pedal. Range is better than the Leaf. Build quality is far worse. 
 
Honda E has one pedal and the 360 cameras. Build quality is nice. 
 
There isn't much choice. 
 
Probably easier to demolish the garage and make a slightly bigger car port!",2023,1,9

"Hmm. A ""Small Family Car"" is what the industry calls ""C segment"" 
 
In familiar ICE terms, that means VW Golf, Vauxhall Astra, Ford Focus. 
 
LEAF, ID3, MG4 are all C Segment vehicles. 
 
If you want something smaller, you should be looking at B-Segment. which in ICE terms would be the Fiesta, Polo, Corsa type cars. MG3 is B segment. As is the Zoe, and ofcourse the Stellantis models such as the e208 and corsa-e etc.  
 
 
All cars are getting larger, i'm not sure why its a particular surprise, given its been happening for 30+ years?

Good points about how accurate the advertised widths are but at least with some of them we know it's a definite no. It's not so much we want a super narrow but why are some of them so wide! 
At the moment It looks like a case of losing the one pedal function and going for the e208",2023,1,9
"My friend has a similar problem - his father built a garage in the early 1970's, without planning permission, basically by using corrugated iron panels around a Mk3 Ford Escort.

He is currently driving a KIA Stonic, which is 1760mm wide 4140 length. 
 
The Stonic is basically sister car to the Hyundai Kona. 
 
The Kona dimensions are 1800mm wide (not including Mirrors) and 4205 length.

This will be a second car for us so I’m not overly worried about range anxiety, the only long journey I currently do is a trip to Nottingham and back twice a month, 160 mile round trip, but I can do that in the diesel which we’ll still have as the ‘larger car’. 
 
I‘m trying to decide between the i3 (standard black interior trim), Honda e (not Advance) and Mini (level 2 spec). I’ve had the i3 on a test drive for a day and have the Honda for 24 hours from Tuesday. The Mini is now becoming more tricky to secure a test drive with Tier 4 restrictions...  
 
Lease prices I have currently based on a 3+36 at 10k miles are i3 - £346, Mini - £338 and the Honda - £366. 
 
Currently feels like the sensible choice is the i3. It’s the larger of the three, bigger range, and as it’s been around a while most of the bugs should be worked out. I’ve got a feeling that the Honda is going to steal my heart though even though it’s the most expensive and has the smallest range... I haven’t completely written off a Mini, the price is great but everything I’ve read and seen suggests it lacks that ‘something special’ you’d want an electric car to bring. 
 
Am I missing something or does anyone have any insight or opinion? Should I spec up the trim levels? The Honda Advance trim adds £75 a month for auto parking rear view camera mirror and a three pin plug socket...  
 
Thanks in advance!",2020,12,31
"I think most reviews I have seen say the Mini is the best fun to drive by far, the Honda is the quirkiest but a bit naff to drive, isn't the I3 old hat now? There are no inherent faults or known issues with the Mini (given that the top is a normal high spec Mini cooper and the bottom is a tried and tested I3 motor and battery).",2020,12,31
"@E7EV  Dropping to 8k miles a year might not be a bad idea. 10k gives me a buffer but I have a sneaky feeling we’ll end up using the ev for most trips other than motorway journeys! 
 
 @DrMagical  you’re spot on about the Mini but I just wish the electric version looked more... electric. It’s probably the middle-ground for me in my decision at the moment, proven i3 tech, low lease cost and it’s a new model to the market.",2020,12,31
Might want to have a look at the videos by the EV Puzzle over on YouTube - he tested the Honda and the Mini to replace his Kona - spoiler alert... went for the Mini,2020,12,31
"The Mini is 100kg heavier than the i3. 
 
At those prices I'd take a new i3.",2020,12,31
"The i3 was very much a car ahead of its time. The battery tech has improved since the original i3 was launched, the drivetrain and construction were always interesting. BMW have sold more each year since it was launched (unlike most cars where they sell most in the first year after release, declines over time, bumps with the facelift then replaced after 7-10 years), and as alluded to above, shoving the i3 guts into the mini shell is a bit of a hack job. 
 
I'd say have a look also at the Mazda mx30 (although the stupid noise that can't be disabled would be an absolute ""nope"" for me) and the Fiat 500, as alternative ""second car"" choices.",2021,1,1
"I currently have an I3 and have test driven the Mini and Honda. 
Ride and handling - The Mini is sort of sportier but I prefer rear wheel drive of the I3. The Honda is nothing special to drive. The I3 has the best 0-60 time. 
Space - the Mini feels a bit cramped and rear seat acces is poor, my wife said no as its a faff to get the weekly shop into it. Access to back seats is best in the Honda and the rear luggage space is small but easy to get at. I am used to driving sports cars and the Mini has that feel, it is something that wraps around you whilst with the Honda and I3 you sit in an open space. 
I am a great fan of AEB and adaptive cruise control so the lack of this was the reason to walk away from the Mini. The I3 system is pretty basic but the ACC works enough of the time to be useful and the AEB system only has to work once to pay for itself so a 50% chance of working is better than nothing. The ACC/AEB system on the Honda is very very good, better than the Tesla Model 3 (which I had before the I3). It has less phantom braking events than the Tesla and is very capable. It doesnt worry about undertaking cars in the centre refuge and unlike the Tesla isn't upset by oncoming double decker buses on narrow roads. 
Gizmos and toys - the Honda is in a different league. The video door mirrors and 360 view are fantastic and I was sold on them after 5 mins, the video rear view mirror is a bit more of an acquired taste but you can switch it off. The interface is rather complex and I think i would still be finding features after 6 months but I would regard these as Easter eggs. I could play for hours in it. 
 
But then RANGE RANGE RANGE. The Mini and Honda simply fail. I test drove both over the summer in temperature of 16-19 C and the range was rapidly ticking downwards from 100 miles as soon as I set off. In the winter I suspect you would be looking at 80 miles which is simply not enough. In my case this would require a full charge every night just to do my commute and one missed charge or a detour and I would be stuck on a country lane somewhere. Whether this is a problem depends on your use case.",2021,1,1
"I feel like the Audi A2 was kind of similar to the i3 in many ways, and was also ahead of its time (and didn't sell well and got canned before it was properly appreciated).",2021,1,1
"Remember too that the Mini is the only one that will easily beat it’s claimed WLTP range. And the elephant in the room, it’s the only cool brand EV.",2021,1,1
"Might not fit the cool car image, but I tested the Zoe ZE50 GT spec a few months ago, and it was really impressive overall (not very powerful though). Leases are from £250 for the top of the line on the carwow calculator...",2021,1,1
"I would wait for the Fiat 500. Good range, good kit and you can have it as a convertible. What’s not to like? Failing that I would get an Ioniq on £200 a month. It would even cover your Nottingham trip.",2021,1,1
I'm also keen on the Fiat but I think i will wait a year to see what actually comes out. Every new EV has had problems with the first off owners being beta testers with no guarantee that their car will get the fixes. This is also Fiats first proper EV so based on history the app won't work and there wil be various failures and incompatibilities.,2021,1,1
"The input so far has been great, thank you everyone! 
 
Watching the EV Puzzle videos was really interesting for the Mini and Honda E comparison. 
 
As for a Fiat 500 I appreciate i’s retro design but I’m not sure it’s quite me...  
 
The ID3 I’d considered, although I’d read they’d seemed to cut a few corners on the interior quality and it didn’t hold up to the Golfs interior? The number of trim levels for the ID3 seems excessive too! I picked a mid-range trim and the monthly lease was coming in at £440-450ish, so around £100 a month more than the i3, Honda E and Mini... 
 
I’ve sort of made peace with the fact that I’ll never use this car for the twice monthly 160 mile trip to Nottingham, the more research I’ve done it seems that even if I got an EV with a 200+ mile range running it at 70 mph for most of the journey would really damage the range. 
 
I’m leaning towards the i3 but the Honda arrives on Tuesday and as a techie I’m really looking forward to experiencing it first-hand.",2021,1,1
"Have you considered Ioniq 38 kWh? Mine has done a one-way 160 mile trip in wet & cold, nonstop, I hypermiled it as was my 1st trip in it, and arrived with 40 miles on the clock. Adaptive CC works really well with radar in nose. WLTP is 193 miles, your 160 mile round trip will be a cinch in summer, and ok in winter at steady 60 I estimate. It's about the most efficient EV, along with Model 3 LR. Having a heatpump really helps it. Nice long warranty as well. Mine's now for sale... ",2021,1,1

"Tesla head count cut: 
 Tesla cuts jobs as cars 'too expensive'  
 
I think there may be a demand problem for the M3, people who can afford and want the more expensive variants have mostly bought them, opening demand to Europe has not seen a huge demand for the expensive models as people all think the cheap one is coming fairly soon and having already waited 2 years, what is another 6 months? 
 
So Tesla actually needs to build and be profitable on the 35k base m3 if it wants to move the metal and at the moment it looks like profitability at that level is difficult but the alternative is accepting lower volumes and again in the car industry that also leads to losses as assets are under-utilised. 
 
What they need of course is a product line that includes SUVs and pickups at all price points but these are not online yet. Can tesla finance the development of these new products to production if the legacy models are not generating any profits? Also the odds are they won't hit the market before VW start producing EVs in some volume so there won't be the 'there is no other EV choice' premium that they have exploited for the M3. 
 
So in summary, Q4 should have seen another good profit same as Q3, Q1 should see a some profit depending on EU and China demand but Q2 onwards things look pretty lean.",2019,1,18

"Hi -  
 
Question is as per the subject - which of the popular EVs at the moment has what they call ""one pedal driving"" - from what I gather this means that you can set the regenerative braking to such a level that the car will completely stop on its own if you are driving smoothly and anticipating the stopping distances correctly? 
 
Also - does this mean the brake lights come on automatically when you have this enabled as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator?",2022,2,1
"Cripes, imagine if you engaged e-pedal with a full battery and you lifted your foot while approaching a roundabout ......and nothing happened.",2022,2,3
"I think I mentioned this earlier, but I am not at all keen on the Leaf's e-pedal anyway. It does work though. I do wonder how the Kona works when the battery is full. Is there still the same level of regen, or are the friction brakes automatically applied?",2022,2,3
"Emergency stop you will want to hit it unless you have complete faith in the AEB saving your bacon 🙈🤞 
 
Here's Bjørn testing out the LEAF on an incline",2022,2,3
"I've never driven the Kona, so no experience with it. In my Chevrolet Bolt, I never touch the brake pedal unless I need to slow faster than regen is accomplishing (it happens sometimes, usually if I wait too late to begin slowing), or coming to a stop on a significant downhill slope. Going uphill is no problem, as the car has a hill hold function. But under 99% of my usual driving conditions I never touch the brake pedal. So that meets the definition of one pedal.  
 
My Niro PHEV would NOT come to a complete stop from regen, as it kicked off at 5 MPH and then coasted. I think the Niro and Kona EVs operate the same, although they do have adjustable levels of regen that my PHEV did not have.",2022,2,3
Just found that Hyundai themselves can't seem to get it right in calling it i-Pedal,2022,2,3
"What this thread really tells you is, if you really want to understand the details of the functions of EVs, get a thorough test drive of three cars on your short list. I would also recommend making the Leaf one of them. It is a very useful benchmark to compare other cars to. 
And that comes from someone who swapped a Leaf for a Lexus EV.",2022,2,4
"The Bolt doesn't require the paddle to come to a stop. Normal regen does that without the need for it or the brake pedal. It simply increased the regen level, and actually does nothing below about 5 MPH. I seldom use it because it's rather abrupt, rather than the smooth increase/decrease that can be accomplished with the brake pedal. But again I rarely have to touch the brake pedal when driving under typical conditions. One Pedal mode provides enough braking/stopping power under almost all conditions.",2022,2,4

"My Ioniq PHEV has variable regen modes I can adjust with the steering wheel paddles. But I wouldn't call it one pedal driving. It's much more for slowing the car when going down hill, the same as you'd do with a manual car putting it in a low gear.",2022,2,5
"Mustang Mach E also has true one-pedal driving, as in when switched on, the car will slow to a complete stop if you take your foot off",2022,2,5
"a good test would be to charge to 100% then get to a relatively high speed like 60mph, then back off. This would generate high kw of regen and that may be more than the battery can take at 100%. Maybe they have a top buffer that can take it for long enough until your battery gets low, or they limit regen, or they use friction brakes. But that would give you an idea I think",2022,2,6
"They should do a carwow test like the 70mph to 0 
 
Take the One-Pedal cars and do a rolling 40mph and simultaneously take their foot off and see which one brings it to a stop the best. 
 
Repeat the test at 100% SoC (for the cars that don't automatically disable One-Pedal and warn you) and see if the friction brakes are used and the stopping distance is identical or longer.",2022,2,6
"I didn’t specify or particularly care how they mechanically do it - point being for ‘cars that can control the friction brakes themselves without driver input’ - it would seem to be logical that they’d try and have a standard retardation when you lift off the throttle - based on speed/slope etc. when regen isn’t 100% possible it can add in friction brakes so you feel no difference 
 
I guess it’s less efficient - better to coast in that scenario to use less energy - but does leave the driver to adapt based on state of charge/battery temperature.",2022,2,6
"In a brake by wire system there's always (at least as of 2022) a fail safe that the brake pedal will cause the brake fluid to get the calipers to grip the pads. 
 
What I'm saying is that is when there is a system failure. Not in normal use. 
 
The brake pedal will be just telling the control unit how much the person's foot is pressed down or released. It's then directly applying the friction brakes (or in the case of EV also deciding if regenerative braking is applied)",2022,2,6

I put my name down as an interested potential customer but since the announcement of the pricing, especially after all the delays since the beginning of the year, have happily taken my name off the list. 
 
Does anyone else think there's a chance this car could still make a success in the UK?

"People drive fugly cars because they are cheap and unstealable. 
When a manufacturer then wants 33% more than the thing should sell for and closer to 50% more than it should be selling for then they shoot themselves in the foot and people get a little disappointed. 
I'd even considered the thing myself but there's much better for not much more which is precisely where 99% of their potential customers started looking as soon as they tried it on with a ludicrous price hike. 
 
Thank all the gods, imagine if they had dropped the price by a similar amount, the streets would have been littered with the fugly little buggers and the air polluted by anyone who could work out how, rolling coal all over them.

"Any supplier will charge the maximum that they think that they can get away with. Look at the current competition:- 
 
VW id3 - £36K 
Renault Megane ev - £35K minimum. 
Cupra Born - £35K minimum 
Vauxhall Mokka-e - £32K minimum. 
So.... Does the £32K for the Ora Cat look unreasonable, against the current market place? Marmite looks not withstanding. It's 10% cheaper than the equivalent VW, Cupra or Renault. 
 
The real BEV market disruptor will be the MG4, coming in at about £26K. If that arrives in sufficient numbers, then that will make the suppliers look very hard at their pricing. 
 
What is a reasonable price for an iPhone 11, based on production cost? - Much, much lower than it is, but Apple sells it for the maximum that it can get away with. Same with Dyson products. (please, no long-term debate about Apple or Dyson products) 
 
Market forces.",2022,8,3
"They have only given details of the ""First Edition"" at 32k so perhaps future models will be cheaper..",2022,8,3
"I love the ORA Cat!  
 
Not because I like the design, but the fact that it polarises people. That's what design should do or we would all be driving around in a model T. I don't think that any of the EVs I have driven look good, the last two being Hyundai Ioniq and Kia eNiro. They are pretty dull to be honest, but great cars. I think Audi's look terrible with their 'Russian doll' design approach, but other people think they look great. 
 
I hope the ORA does launch in the UK. For me (as I have posted elsewhere) the price looks about right in the current environment. It will compete against more 'stylised' EVs like the 500, Mini (30K+) and Honda e (34-37K). And it is the 'claimed' size of an ID3, so looks about right on the pricing front. I know it is Chinese etc, but I am old enough to remember when people made similar comments about Japanese and Korean cars. Unlike German cars it will come with 5 year warrantee, so should be OK I expect. In the current environment we can expect the same pricing rules to hold true; I paid £160 month for my first EV based on 10K per year miles for a Mercedes, I will never see that happen again and don't expect it either. 
 
I also remember that people said that the Tesla 3 would be from £27k Tesla because Musk said it would be $35k in the USA before any subsidies. But, by the time it launched the price had risen to £42k. The lesson; take a launch price with a big pinch of salt and it is probably media hyperbole anyway.",2022,8,3
"I don't think you would be able to get the same/similar spec as the P45 for £42k! 
Don't forget it is AWD and the Premium AWD is £48,900 without any extras the P45 has. 
The Namsan edition is probably closer and that is £56,400.... 
 
My other half likes the Ora cat as we did see them at Fully charged, Farnborough, but the price is stupidly high, so will be interested to see what the MG4 is like in the flesh and also what the big battery version cost is going to be. If it is under £30k, MG should be onto a winner.",2022,8,3
"The Cat is an objectively poor design and the car is uncompetitive in other respects at it’s price point,. Even if neither were true it would be very hard and costly to establish it in the market. MG is a poor comparison: they’ve got brand equity and have been selling Chinese cars through a dealer network for a decade or more. Ora just didn’t do their research. The UK is a surprisingly discerning market.",2022,8,3
"I dont think the Ora Cat is dead…..I just think it’s severely wounded, having shot itself in the foot with what has to go down as a “bungled” launch 
They must have known they were not not ready…..still no confirmed Dealers let alone actual cars to be bought",2022,8,4

"FYI - The first batch of Ora Cats in UK spec left Shanghai a couple of weeks ago. 
My guess would be that they're on either the Michigan Highway due in Bristol on Sept 8th, or the Eurasian Highway due on the 11th",2022,8,26
"They are using International Motors as their UK importer. 
 
Of Subaru fame. 
 
They're fukt - MG4 will kill them off unless the price drops £5k+",2022,8,26

What do you mean? 
 
Are you asking

""Is it a competitor to MG4""

"I'm going to hold my opinion about value until I'm able to test drive them.

"Disclaimer: This is a truly bonkers idea and in no way to be judged as creative thinking. 
 
Just crossed my mind.. 
You know when you buy a laptop you can upgrade the memory, right? 
Why not having upgrade slots in the boot where you could buy battery packs? 
You could opt to sacrifice some boot space, in my case mine is empty most of the time and when I travel the luggage takes less than half the space. 
You could then have an increased range with no need to expensive upgrades.",2019,8,21
"HEY!!! 
That's my idea.

"1. For the additional complexity and impracticality of hooking up some extra 'optional' battery capacity, you could have a bigger battery in the first place. At less overall cost! Hint: nobody will want a 'base model' 62 mile range EV. 
 
2. Didn't Fiat already make a 'compliance car' electric 500??",2019,8,21
"My line of thought was that if you are willing to sacrifice boot space because you're not going to use it it could be an option to add some additional packs. 
Wasn't thinking about removable ones. 
As I said initially,  
1 it's a bonkers idea   
2 just to add some extra miles to the ""normal"" range. 
If you could fit 2 packs at 60 miles each would be an extra 120 miles, that's the range for a 40kw leaf",2019,8,21
"In Fiat's case, the extra batteries slide in under the floor, and do not affect boot space.",2019,8,21
I guess the car would have to be designed so that the weight distribution was not changed too much. Putting a lot of batteries in the boot space might cause problems so it might be better to have empty slots under the floor. Not starightforward though.,2019,8,23

"OK, that is a very open question, I will add some qualifiers. 
I am on my second Zoe (22kwh) and will happily sing it's praises but probably not the sort of thing my pa would like to drive. 
He is now in his mid 70's and currently drives an old P reg diesel Toyota Carina ! It's not that he can't afford a new car just he is to stubborn and tight to buy a replacement.....until now. 
His car has now become ""a bit jerky"" and is so old it doesn't even have an obd2 port to figure out what might be up with it 
 
As he has retired there is no need to worry abut the commute but he is still plenty active and sticking a large amount of stuff in the boot is fairly common. My mother has another car so even really long trips don't really need to figure in to the equation. 
 
I'm thinking of pushing him to have a test drive of the MG5 as that is about as close as I can think of to what he has without going for silly money. 
 
In the classifieds there is a very nice Ampera that would probably suit him as well, but it's hard to test drive anything like that though and still have plenty of time to think about it.  
I do wonder if a model S would float his boat. I think it would just be a bit too big. 
 
I don't want him spending all of my inheritance   but wonder if anyone else managed to persuade an older relative to go EV?",2021,5,6
"Ampera's a great car, but you do sit very low. Is that mine in the classifieds you saw? I'm 68, but stll very slim & flexible, 6' tall, 11 stone, so have no problems getting in & out. Wouldn't recommend if you have back trouble/arthritis/overweight etc. 
 
Main issue with these is they're now out of the 8-year warranty on the High Voltage stuff, so you do need to have say £1500 stashed away just in case. And with Amperas you need a dealer who can cope competently with those issues, if they happen. Which is why I've been using Bellingers in Wantage, even though they're 45 miles away! 
 
I've replaced it with Ioniq 38, very similar in many ways, easier to get into though! 2nd hand these are a great car I think, loving mine, though the early-build ones are now going into a battery-recall/replace process. Ones built mid-2020 on should be fine, details in Hyundai threads if interested. 5 yr wty is nice on the usual car parts, 8 on the battery stuff I think.",2021,5,6
"Maybe an eniro? Good boot space, higher so easier to get into and 7 year warranty",2021,5,6
"Big qn though, what's his budget? If he's not super-keen to swap cars, he may not be super keen to splash out 15-20k on a decent BEV! In which case, Ampera from around 7.5k is a cracking alternative, as it's pure BEV inside its 45 mile summer range.",2021,5,6
"He's a classic miser like my Dad by the sound of it. It will be a tough job to get him in any EV. I think he'd be happier with a £10k nearly new ICE car rather than a £20-£30k EV unfortunately. Mine loves carting crap around in the boot as well.   
 
Top and bottom of it the extra purchase costs of EVs means you don't get the fuel money back unless you're doing silly miles a year.",2021,5,6
"My Dads 82, just got rid of his 25 year old Landrover and bought a new Polo R line. 
 
He’s driven my ID3 and loves it, he’s threatening to buy one. My only concern is the speed, the Landrover got to 60 in about 2 minutes, whereas the ID3 takes less than 8 seconds. 
 
My poor Mum doesn’t want him to get one, she says he’s too old to be racing around. My Dads just smiles, but keeps sneaking off in mine - says he likes the Head up Display and CarPlay. 
 
I don’t know what to think, so I’m staying out of it.",2021,5,6
"Forgot to mention budget.  
He isn't short of a few bob or two but I'd think trying to get him to part with 50k for a car would be like trying to get blood from a stone. He isn't adverse to that sort of thing though, not exactly a tight arse more just careful. Many many years ago I came home from school to find two brand new cars side by side on the drive with sequential plates. They weren't good car at all and British Leylend can take all of that blame but he did throw some money at it back in the day.  
 
Ha, manage to completely forget about the eniro. Not sure if the SUV style will fit with him but as my parents are coming over this afternoon I will start to drag out more info, but I like it so that is on the list. 
Id rather push him towards the full EV than a hybrid as I took the eniro hybrid for a test drive a while back and did not like that all. Only a single point of reference though. 
 
He will want something that now ""see's him out"" as he has mentioned a few times. Probably more like just needs to be the last car he owns before we take his licence off of him. Not looking forward to that conversation in the future.",2021,5,6
If its going to see him out then it should be fun How about the fiat 500 cabrio?,2021,5,6
"Or The Tesla Model S Plaid 
 
You could borrow it and also have fun",2021,5,6
"Id go with your MG5 suggestion as well, its a lot of car for the money and pushes over the 200 mile range which I think for many is a mental hurdle around range anxiety - seem to be some good pre-owned prices around as well",2021,5,6
"I'd look at the MG5 or MG ZS EV, depending on which he finds more comfortable/easy to access.",2021,5,6
"If charging away from home might be something that he’d struggle to plan for and all the associated apps and so on, I’d forget the EV idea and steer him towards a Corolla touring sports hybrid or if he’s feeling flush a Lexus IS hybrid. Bullet proof and will see him out with no head aches.",2021,5,6
"I’ve had a LEAF for nearly 7 years, and my dad (67) has been showing more and more interest in EV’s of late…. we had a few chats about Tesla’s over the lockdowns but he always said he liked the look of the BMW iX more, but it was even more pricey. Anyway, he called me up last week and said he's sold his bmw 2 series diesel, no longer has a car, and is waiting on the delivery of a Tesla 3LR!! Think his recent inheritance helped matters, but now I can’t wait for lockdown rules to mean I can go stay over and visit it, err… I mean him!",2021,5,6
"My dad is 84 and in late 2018 I, and my mum, persuaded him to buy a Zoe ZE40 R110 new from our local Renault dealer. He loved it and earlier this year, after taking a ride in my Zoe ZE50 R135, traded it in for a ZE50 R110 for the extra range and nicer interior. 
A few months after my dad bought his first Zoe, I noticed a pre reg one at the dealer and told my uncle (75), he went and had a look and bought it the following day. 
I know it's not as big as the Carina but the boot isn't a bad size and if there's only two of them and he wants to cart a lot of gear about he could fold the rear seats down.",2021,5,6
"Well I'm fast approaching 77 and recently made the swap to a BEV, I also considered the range issue and was thinking PHEV, but when I started researching it the BEV made more sense as I suspect I shall only need to charge at home for virtually all my journeys and the increasing prevalence of chargers made any longer journey not the problem that I previously envisaged. I still struggle with smartphones though !",2021,5,6
If your Dad likes Toyota's then perhaps one of those new self-charging ones....... I'll get my coat😁,2021,5,6
"Well I am 73 coming on 74 and have mobility issues but drive an MG ZS EV. I love it for the ease of driving and the reversing camera. I too am tight with money (the kids will get a fortune) so couldn't bring myself to buy the Kona which we tried at the same time 20 months ago. Not that I couldn't afford it just couldn't see where the extra value was in it apart from the range. The only downside to the MG is the silly lift up charging port, I can't think of anything else that bugs me. It is quiet and a great drive on motorways. Mine is the Exclusive and I love the radio, great sound quality and it pulls in many DAB stations my indoor portable doesn't. The interior may not be quite the standard of my Passat which has the full leather etc. but it actually doesn't bother me and funnily an Audi driver looked into it one day to say his wife wanted an SUV style car and said he liked the interior and the leather... I didn't disabuse him 😃. Its a great car and sounds like it fits with his spending wishes. More than that the rear seat is good for larger people, I have 2 friends over 6 ft tall and don't think that it will be a squash.",2021,5,6
"Nissan Leaf for sure. Its the Ford Focus of EVs. Big enough, fast enough, efficient enough, has enough gizmos without a stupid big screen (that I think Dad wouldn't like), and it's very comfortable and not outragiosly expensive. Front wheel drive helps. 
There are other EVs that will do some of those things better or cheaper but it will be hard to find one that is better than the Leaf in all respects. Getting a test drive usually convinces people of the advantages of EVs.",2021,5,7
"Hey folks, 
 
I'd mumbled about this in other threads, but thought I'd start a new thread for reference. 
 
Recently, when going to pull the dust cover from the Type 2 Charge Socket on the E-Up! It has not been releasing. As of course is part of the spec on the Type 2 socket, there is a small pin which locks the plug, and also in the case of the dust cover, in to prevent it being pulled out. 
 
When unlocking the car, you can normally hear this pin release. When it doesn't release, I don't hear the noise. 
 
My current strategy is to keep locking and unlocking the car (probably not good for the locks!) and pulling the plug. 
 
I've spoken to JCB VW and they'll be able to look at it in a couple of weeks. I'll report back on their findings!",2014,9,26
Is the pin just sticking? Perhaps some chain lubricant or similar (not something like WD40).,2014,9,26
JCB VW? Only available in yellow?,2014,9,26
I think it's more a software bug rather than there being anything actually faulty with the pin - it just has a mind of its own about whether it releases or not!!!,2014,9,26
"Aah. The old IT two-step.. 
 
I did think that turning the ignition on and off made a difference, but now I'm not so sure.",2014,9,26

"Hello toms, 
 
I have the exact same problem, and use the same workaround: press car open repeatedly on the key remote until the port releases the cover or charge plug. 
 
I have an appointment this week at my dealer's service workshop for the replacement of the charge port, which takes two days of work because it also incurs changing the cable from the port to the inverter... 
 
Regards, 
Stéphane",2014,10,18
Yep. Is quite a big job - the E-Up is still in the garage. To change the charge socket involves taking the battery out and a lot of trim. The part is on back order too.. In hoping to have the car back early next week.,2014,10,18
"Hi Toms, 
 
I just got my e-Up back from the service workshop. Brought it in last tuesday evening so that they could start working on it early Wednesdey morning; took them wed+thu+fri+mon, that's 4 full days. 
 
They replaced the charge port's lock mechanism, but as you already know this also takes replacing the AC+DC cable running from the charge port to the inverter/battery. Thus they had to detach/reattach the battery from under the car, and that seems to be a lot of work, each screw was tightened to prescripted torque using suitable wrenches etc. 
 
They also applied the ""97AR quality action"", which is threefold: ECU software update + replace 12V battery negative cable + replace a fuse. 
 
My dealer told me this was the 1st e-Up in France to be serviced apart from software update, so they took their time, and were in touch with the competent german headquarters who provided required tooling and instructions. They also had to create an ""electric area"" in the workshop ; the job was done by their only trained guy, who told me he learnt a lot. 
 
My dealer's people are very nice, and went as far as to send me pictures taken at various stages of the process. 
 
Regards, 
-- 
Stéphane",2014,10,27
"Hi Stephane, 
 
Mine is still in the workshop for the same procedure and 97AR Quality Action. It has been 2 weeks now, and I do not have my car back! 
 
Apparently the cable from the charge port to the inverter was replaced first, but the fault still remained through extensive testing. They are now changing a shorter loom from the ECU to inverter Hopefully this fixes it. 
 
Thankfully, the awesome  @Darren Smith  has provided me a Leaf on a 7 day loan to try out - maybe I'll convert to the Leaf camp if the E-Up! proves to remain problematical!! 
 
Tom",2014,10,27
oooh - looks like it's fixed! collecting later today ,2014,10,29
"Glad to hear that   
 
Please ask them some details about the procedure and any kind of odds they ran into, so we will consolidate our knowledge !",2014,10,29
"I would, but I'll be sending my partner to go and pick it up.. hopefully, I'll get some kind of job card/report with it.",2014,10,29
"So.. We got the Up back and the charge port solenoid works, but the car isn't reporting time to charge properly, and more worryingly, won't rapid charge!!!! So currently stuck at Lakeside IKEA on the type 2 plug at 16A and eating a lot of meatballs as we won't get back at this rate in the cold and dark.  
 
Faith in VW failing... ",2014,11,5
"Well, more oddness today with the range reporting all over the place, so we called out VW assist. The 'very very nice man' from 'VW assist' *cough* The AA, scanned it and declared the charger controller unit probably fooked. So, low loader arriving tomorrow and poor little Upton will once again be in the garage. As a courtesy car we've been offered a Fiat 500 petrol - erm? Really?",2014,11,6
"That's not good, and the loan car a bit of an odd choice. Similar size I guess.",2014,11,6
"Except that at 6'1 I can fit in an E-up, but not in a Fiat 500!!!",2014,11,6
"Sad to hear you're still having issues... 
 
My fixed (read: changed) charge port seems to work fine. But the first one did fine too for a couple months, so i keep fingers crossed. 
 
My dealer told me that a new quality action popped up last week (not the 97ar one but a newer one), this time relative to a new firmware to flash into the motor ecu. I will have it done next thursday. 
 
I seem to be luckier than you, because they offered me a shiny new golf gte for the day   
 
Regards, 
 
Stéphane",2014,11,7
"Hi Stéphane, 
 
It's back in the garage as of two hours ago - they towed it to the dealer 50 miles away (not that happy about that - I think it should have gone on a low loader, but hey). The Fiat 500 didn't happen - I really am too big! I have a Polo 1.2 60hp horrible horrible horrible car. No wonder it is cheap (for a VW). 
 
I'll see if they do the new quality action too.",2014,11,7
"By the way i cannot tell if mine charges ok on anything else than regular home plug, as i have no access to any high power charge station in my area... 
 
I wish you that they fix your up and you're quick back to the very enjoyable drive of this car. 
 
Regards, 
Stéphane",2014,11,7
"Call from the dealer today - they think that a controller unit is out of date compared to the other new parts they have fitted. A new part has been ordered, but they are unsure as yet when it will be in. They'll then fit this part and see if it rapid charges and knows how much charge it has. 
 
What I don't like is when they take it in for repair, the first thing they do is fully charge it and then leave it fully charged.   
 
Next May I can hand the car back... If it still continues to be troublesome, I will be doing just that I think. And I'll definitely know not to buy a VW Polo 1.2 60PS!",2014,11,11
Such a disappointment. ,2014,11,11
"You should see the rant I sent to VW CS - the dealer are actually quite good, if stabbing in the dark a little at times. VW Mobility Assist are a joke - staffed by giggling teenagers and unable to comprehend the concept of actioning a promise of 'ringing you back', unless someone else in the dept ringing you back with the same info you just got counts?! 
 
Amazed how much better Vauxhall are than VW so far!",2014,11,11
"I have been such a VAG fan for many years too - but of late, I've had problems with every Volkswagen or Skoda I've bought (about 6 in the last few years)",2014,11,11
"Still being repaired..... Got a courtesy Golf 7 petrol now.  
 
I want to love VW, but this whole going wrong thing is starting to grate... 
 
More news as I get it.",2014,11,18
"Hello toms, 
 
Wishing you luck... 
 
Mine is flawless since the charge port was replaced. It went to the dealer again for a software update session, there were 9 software modules updated, from motor to regen brake through air con, elec assisted steering etc. Couldn't say I've seen anything changed since. 
 
Today i logged my 8000th km since i got it in april, couldnt be happier... 
 
Regards, 
Stéphane",2014,11,18
"Thanks Stephane!  
 
Rapid charging is fixed now - woohoo! There is still an error with the charge time remaining stuff though. Hopefully it'll be sorted tomorrow.",2014,11,18
"All sorted finally by the dealer - I've the latest charger unit, charge port and software and all quality actions done. The GOM is now far more accurate, and I swear it feels faster!!  
 
I'm planning on selling the car though - I'm now finding I need to go to Bournemouth from Essex a lot more often so need a bigger car and most likely a PHEV/REX",2014,12,13
"""Mine is flawless since the charge port was replaced."" 
 
Since we had our faulty charge cable replaced our e-up! has been faultless too. I am asking for trouble saying this! We have never had the problem with the charge port cover not releasing. So far... 
 
But with 2,500 miles up we love it and it makes our Octavia diesel seem really clunky. Our motorhead son in law had a spin recently and kept commenting on the big car feel.  
 
And we are heading for the time of year when charging is covered by our solar panels.",2015,1,7
"I'm glad to hear it is going well  @JamesW  I'm very happy again with our E-Up! since its earlier hiccups. The longer journeys make me wish it had Chademo not CCS (or a range extender!), but I've yet to be flatbedded! 
 
Although I would sell it (to move to a larger EV), I'm really loving it still. Great little car.",2015,1,7
"I have to admit we haven't plucked up courage to try a public charger at all yet. It still seems a jungle. There is an ecotricity CCS point at the Çhievely services half way to Oxford but we wouldn't have the range to make the whole journey or back home again if for some reason we couldn't use it. So we give the Skoda a run! 
 
Practical advice and experience from you or anyone else would be hugely appreciated. It is one of my new year resolutions to stop being so feeble.",2015,1,7
"Every time I've tried to plug in, I've found the cover wouldn't pull out. But on every such occasion just pressing the unlock button on key fob (even though rest of locks were undone) the cover solenoid clicked and cover could be released. 
 
I'd assumed this was 'normal behaviour' - is it not ?",2015,10,10

They had silly, expensive GM engines that are unreliable and thirsty, as well as sitting in high tax brackets. They are also a bit lardy, so can cope with the battery weight.

"Jaguar XF, outgoing model. No remotely economical petrols, and after the DPF problems on my S-type on top of the usual oil burner drawbacks of narrow rev band, turbo lag, agricultural rattling noise at low speed and of course the horrid fumes and smell at the pump, I'd never run a diesel engine again. 
 
Other than the engines, the XF is lovely, one of the most feel-good cars I've driven, happy to play or to chill - perfect for an electric drivetrain. 
 
Other than that.. I'd love to see an EV supercar which mechanically amplified motor, transmission and regenerative brake noises into the cabin, and implemented a multi-speed gearbox. For the sake of the thread, let's just make it a Miura, because if you're going to use any supercar, why not the prettiest... 
 
(You know, why not, aside from the million pounds of the car itself, the additional fortune to convert it and remain roadworthy, the loss of one of the greatest combustion powertrains in history and the army of purists who would most likely hire assassins to slowly poison you like a turncoat KGB agent for even thinking about it)",2016,2,29

"So with having the Tekna and LED headlamps I've decided to start swapping some of the other incandescent bulbs for LED's too.

I've always wondered why I have LED dipped lights, but not LED DRLs!",2016,1,10
"@Paul_Churcley. Yeah bit fiddly.  
I took out two bolts that hold the arch liner to the bumper underneath then pulled the arch liner out. The gets access to the bulb.  
They're stiff to twist in (stock ones are too).  
Top tip feel which way round the holder goes before you take it out. Makes refitting easier.  
 @chrisnsteffie  yeah I can't understand why most of the bulbs are incandescent. Surely when your propulsion power is electricity you don't want to waste it with inefficient bulbs.  
Next on my list are number plate and side lights then possibly main beam and fogs but they aren't cheap.  
Not sure how well the LED indicator replacements work.",2016,1,10

Can't see these saving traction battery SoC (the eBay listing claims ""save energy"")

10W LED must be close to or exceed the dipped beam headlights! Look at the front of the car with the headlights on, are the DRLs now brighter? 
 
They do look nice and very very bright ",2016,1,15
"Not sure, I'll have a look. More the fact that they look better. As mines a Tekna with the LED headlights it's hard to say. Definitely better that the tea lights as std.",2016,1,15
"Something I have never thought about (and my current car does not have DRL's), do they turn off automatically when you switch the main dipped headlights on ? If not and these are in fact brighter than the headlights are there any downsides to that ? (just seems to feel wrong somehow)",2016,1,15

Going to have to have another look when I have a bit more time.  @dawesy  Is it just the bolts at the bottom of the wheel arch liner at the front of the car you removed?

"It is very much a cult. In fact, IMO Elon Musk has a cult following. Others with a similar cult-like following - Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Apple... people support them or buy their products regardless of how good they are or what they do. They polarise opinion very strongly. 
 
I am one of the very few people that tells it as I see it without any cultish love or hate. I form my opinions based very much on what I see in the public domain and from the experiences of my friends and family. I have no axe to grind, no hidden agenda, with Tesla or Musk. My opinions have been formed over 12 years of carefully watching what they do and how they do it and I have said this many times on this forum and elsewhere... I would love to be able to buy a Tesla. 
 
In fact, having just recently bought a nearly new eNiro I went through an extended assessment of Tesla because I dearly wanted one. I always have wanted one! The tech is alluring and being an out and out techie I have always felt a strong attraction to the cars. I came to the conclusion that as a consumer the only way I could be true to my heart is to act with my feet and wallet and not to give in to the contradictions. 
 
It is only a car at the end of the day as  @Tooks  says... but it is the largest purchase most people will make apart from their home and so it is important that my hard-earned cash goes to a company that I at least have no major issues with. It is a sizable wad of cash and while it is probably true that all companies have skeletons that we could criticize them for I want to spend my money with companies that have skeletons I can live with. Another good example is P&O Ferries, I will now never travel P&O Ferries again because of their treatment of staff... RyanAir... because of their appalling treatment of both staff and customers... I could go on - I can hear you all now saying ""NOOOO! Please don't!"" so I won't but you get my drift here. One person makes no difference to these companies, I get that... but it isn't about changing them... it is about me living with my spending decisions ",2022,4,20
"It's a cult and cult have limitations in terms of size they can reach. Membership price rising and benefits reducing so recruitment slowing down. 
 
With new choices coming to market, Tesla taking more than 6 years from announcement to market with new models Roadster, Semi, Cybertruck, I think market is going to swallow Tesla very soon, no later than 5 quarters from now. 
Even expected update of Model 3 can't save it. 
 
In many markets, Tesla already dropping from top. 
Model 3 struggling to keep sales volume, Model Y has few more months before cult members get deliveries and in broader market it has no chance. 
 
Tesla revenue is only from 2 models, Model Y not so desirable or affordable and Model 3 is past prime. Model S and X dead, Roadster and Cybertruck too niche. Tesla also raising prices, makes situation worse. 
This is reason I see Tesla still do ok this year but from second part of next year they are going to see floor fall under them.",2022,4,20
The fact Tesla can move around the massive Model Y more efficiently than the tiny Fiat 500 tells you everything.,2022,4,20
"Model S is a bit shit now (as well as unavailable in the UK just now). 
 
Porsche has caught Tesla up IMO - it might have lower range and interior space but it is more desirable and far higher quality (though the ""Turbo"" variants are stupidly expensive).

I just talked to someone looking to buy new car, trying to direct towards EV and she's more excited about plug-in Cupra Formentor or maybe MG ZS than Tesla. 
She said word for word: I visited Tesla today and they just have ipad in the middle, boring, why do people buy that? 
 
To give perspective, 
Renault is going 100% electric by 2030. 
Fia fully electric by 2030 
Peugeot fully electric by 2030 
Mercedes fully electric by 2030 
Volvo fully electric by 2030 
Lexus fully electric by 2030. 
Bentley fully electric by 2030 
Rolls fully electric by 2030 
Maserati fully electric by 2030 
Cupra fully electric by 2030 
Toyota 3.5 million electric cars by 2030 
 
2030 is 7.5 years from now, remember Tesla Semi and Roadster unveiling was 4.5 years ago and still no Tesla semi or Roadster on the roads. 
 
I think Tesla will be irrelevant a few years from now and I don't think it's good investment or value to buy cars from them. You are buying the top and top is for bagholders. 
We also live in unstable economic context, smallest thing like China conflict with Taiwan can trigger big big big problems for world economy including Tesla.

"Objective environmental impact of Tesla BEV model can only be measured by comparing emissions caused by existance of Tesla with emissions saved by existance of Tesla. 
 
-Emissions caused by Tesla existance: flying in 15000 people from all over US into Texas to hold self-celebrating cult party, carbon-intensive battery raw material mining, Space X program funding resulting in lots of emissions, offset emissions due to non-green electricity used by Tesla cars even at Superchargers, destruction of forest in Berlin for new plant, Elon Gulfstream jet flying back and forth between Texas and California, and probably forget to list so many. 
-Emissions saved by Tesla existance: emissions saved by drivers using carbon-free energy. 
 
Are you sure balance is positive for environment? 
 
Only one thing is sure thing: hypocrisy.

Each one of these Gulfstream flights is equal to one of you driving Tesla for nothing for 100k miles with no account for using non-carbon-free electricity or carbon emitted to produce battery.",2022,4,23

If CIA or Elon want you killed for whatever reason can they push a button remotely and send your Tesla smashing into wall and make it look like accident? 
Can they make a Tesla smash into car of someone they want killed? Cars can be used as weapons in this way and then impossible to prove fault. 
 
If you look Elon Musk's history, everything he touched gives government access to data. 
Zip gives access to files, PayPal gives access to money movements, Tesla gives access to people location, access to smartphone, conversations on phone and inside car, also surveillance through multiple camera's and connectivity. 
Starlink constellation of low orbit satellites looks like spy satellite constellation. 
Even Powerwall connects to your home wifi network. Lot 
Money seems to drop on Musk's lap from nothing. 
 
I think Musk could be front for US government agency and all Fan Bois here could just be government agency staff promoting this scheme.

"I assume Tesla may or may not add this extra screen because sales are obviously poor because people do not like the one screen? 
 
Have you driven/ owned a model 3 to be able to add a valid comment on how user friendly it is or is not?",2022,4,24
"One of the many reasons I decided to sell my Model 3 was the screen, TBH. Mostly trying to use the touch screen with my non-dominant hand when driving, but also because the speed display was partly hidden by my left hand (after the software update that moved it over to the right a bit more). If I adjusted the seat to see the whole screen I then found the seating position uncomfortable. I did look at fitting an after market HUD, pricey, but I thought it would have been worth it to get key information in my line of sight. TBH, the lack of a HUD was one of the downsides to getting the Tesla, not sure why they didn't fit one as standard, given that so many much cheaper cars have them. Perhaps it's just that I'd had years of driving cars with a HUD that caused me to miss it so much.",2022,4,24
"@Tooks  and Jeremy 
Very valid points and i totally get them, i was really unsure about the single screen but as it turns out i like it, i would also like options to be able to re arrange stuff on there to suit me, info i want there or not etc but it is what it is and i accept it. 
 
If Tesla did add another screen, or give the option i can see the good points in that also. 
 
I do not get TD’s apparent hatred of everything Elon, i do respect his opinion though and it really does not bother me, nobody is perfect, i sure as Hell and far from it and neither is Musk but he and Tesla have done a lot of things for the greater good so maybe a bit of acceptance of that fact is worthy.",2022,4,24

 Fiat: 500e Electric Sport  
 
This is the opportunity to purchase a like new 500e outside of CA. This was only sold in CA as a compliance car for fiat - bummer as its such an awesome car!!! I'm going mobile and fulltime RV life, and I have a smaller custom built EV I'm working on as a project - so this one has to go.. Only asking what I owe - I'm not trying to make any money off sale... Held by Chase bank..",2016,8,18

This car is ridiculously zippy - (I went from a big hemi 300C sedan to this little car) I will never buy another gas car.. It averages 80 miles per charge if you have a heavy foot like me.. Baby driving may get 90 and I've seen over 100 on my meter.. 
Vegas is hot, so AC loads are always there.. 
I forget how horrible gas cars are!!!! When ever I'm in one now, it seams noisy, shifts randomly, is slow and delayed between foot and road speed. I can't say enough good things about this car..  
My favorite thing is stopping at lights and the absolute silence and no vibration in the car - the way it should be ",2016,8,18
"Of the mid priced EVs this car has the most acceleration! It's 1 sec under Tesla P85D for 0-30mph.  
0-30mph 2.7sec 
0-60mph high 7sec 
 
I usually fully charge in about 1 hour with my normal driving, and it's been an absolute joy to own this car. 
 
My only reason to sell is to free my credit. I also own a 50% completed EV conversion from a MG Midget (going all brushless) and will finish and use as a tow car behind my 45' diesel coach RV...",2016,8,18
"A tough sell into Europe. 
 
I don't think they are homologated for Europe. Would have to undergo a SVA if it is imported. 
 
I think also 25% car tax and 20% VAT might also apply. 
 
Then if something goes wrong, it'd have to be shipped back to the US. 
 
Nice car. Agree with other comments, would be good if they sold them here. Unfortunately not. 
 
Good luck!",2016,8,18

"‘How my electric car is helping to power my home’ 
 
 
 
A pilot scheme run by energy company OVO is allowing some electric car owners to use their vehicle to power their homes. 
 
Owners can buy electricity from the grid at off-peak rates to charge their vehicle and whatever is leftover in the car’s battery can be used to power their homes or sell it back to the grid at peak times when prices are higher.

"Its all about your expectations. New parts alone will cost more than your budget. 
I had one guy who was adamt that his £4k budget would get him a conversion (done for him) that could do 100 miles / charge and with fast 0 to 70 speed. Just unrealistic. You have to convert because you want the car. Not because its a cheap way of getting an EV, it isnt. 
Most of the cars you list are possible, but with all such cars the placement of the battery pack is the challenge if you wish to retain full boot space. A compromise.  
Fixed gear is perfectly good for many applications, and simplifies any conversion as you dont need to build a new flywheel. But you could use the gearbox, say in 1st or second for faster acceleration, and then just leave it in 2nd or 3rd for simple driving. 
Used parts are a good option, especially used Leaf packs.  
A lot of the parts I hold in stock such as HPEVS AC50 motors and Curtis controllers are new but old stock, but also substantially cheaper than newly importing from the USA. To make these function I hold cabling contactors throttle pots , and make the motor couplings / adaptor plates to suite each application. 
My own preference would be the MX5 or MGF, the latter has a lot going for it, especially as you can get a lot of aftermarket bits including spring replacements / adjustable spring mounts. Later models are also cheap, and ones with dodgy K series engines/ cylinder head problems do come up a lot. Im just under 6ft tall and find it increasingly difficult to get in and out of these cars. Something to consider for longer term ownership.",2017,2,4

"I just love my Smart Conversion, not the fastest in the world, but so much fun. I have another one thats waiting for me to rebuild it (silver 2008) having been a prototype conversion by another company. With the battery pack under the floor, its just so stable. I also have used motors and curtis controller to suit and adaptor plates for the 451 already made. The battery pack could readily be built with Leaf cells. But the great thing is nothing intrudes into the usable space inside. 
The only issue I have with the Smart is the gear ratios. Mine is in third and is a touch sedantary, it will do 70mph down hill with the wind behind but 2nd would give a more spirited performance, but would not get much above about 55. I inadvertantly got it into reverse when I last rebuilt it, with the motor running in the correct direction it would burn rubber up to about 15mph, but run out of puf quickly.  
Might be worth looking at how one could control the motorised gear change, but in mine I had to remove that to get the charger and BMS under the rear floor.",2017,2,4

"Actually a lot of MGFs are scrapped because of engine failures. Head gaskets arnt a simple job on the K series, as they have through bolts down to the bottom of the engine  base.These bolts have to be changed and often arnt. Many garages just replace the head gasket which soon goes again requiring skimming of the head or worse still the block. Owners are regularly getting £500 bills for K series head gasket failures. Hence why people often walk away from them at that point. 
MX5 is a readily available and economic option, The Honda s2000 is always an expensive beast and always fetches higher prices. Even with a bu88ered engine. Its also a bit heavier, and body panels are not cheap. 
I think I would go for the MG or the MX5, probably edging towards the MG as parts are readily available for brakes suspension etc, and body panels are plentiful should you need them. 
With a bit of careful planning you should be able to buy and convert something of the size you are looking for, for the £15k budget. But you may need to do some of the work or running around yourself to keep the cost down. For instance could you extract the original drive train your self ?

I will stick with the fiat 500 for the moment, as having a third member of the family (not yer a teenager) we cant all get into the smart and I cant justify more two seaters in the personal fleet.

Thanks again ",2020,1,28
"Thanks Tony, 
I didn't actually realise the range was so small on lots of EV's. You see the range of 168 and assume the best when in reality its much much worse. 
 
You are right about the 3 it does seem to be the very best option, performance, tech and range. 
 
many thanks",2020,1,28
"Leaf 40 is pushing it unless there is work place charging. If you had guaranteed workplace charging then lots of different EVs would be workable. 
 
Tesla Model 3 is probably the best all rounder right now if you have the money for one.",2020,1,28
"My rule of thumb to avoid relying on charging en-route is that an EV's actual achievable summer range (not NEDC/WLTP fantasy figures) should be at least twice that of the commute it's required to regularly do. 
 
This allows for the combination of: 
 
1) Reduced range in winter and with heater use. 
2) Unexpected diversions/delays due to road/traffic problems especially in winter. (where you might get stuck in stationary traffic having to run the heater to keep warm etc) 
3) Unanticipated errands on the way home. 
4) Unanticipated headwinds or very wet weather, which can eat into range a lot. 
5) Battery degradation over time. (!) 
6) Avoiding range anxiety due to any of the above. 
 
Buying an EV whose range under ideal conditions is only a little bit more than the commute length is simply asking for trouble. Apart from the anxiety it causes, all it takes is higher winter consumption and/or battery degradation over time before you find yourself unable to make your journey without charging. I speak from first hand experience... 
 
If an EV someone is looking at can't do double their commute length then they either have an unusually long commute or they're buying the wrong car! 
 
Another important thing to keep in mind if your commute is long enough that you'll have to charge for the return leg is that you can't count on a 100% charge for the return leg. It takes too long on a rapid charger so you need to use 80% of the nominal range figure for any legs of the journey that occur after charging. This can really eat into any assumptions about how far the car can go. The only exception would be work place charging that allows you to get to 100% during the day, however on a very long commute this may not be possible anyway.",2020,1,28
Or just use the Golf R.,2020,1,28
"Yes you are absolutely correct on the range to commute. I will probably need the extended range M3 to be safe just watched a carwow range video and it managed 269miles. Interestingly the Kia Nero did 255 mile which is also very impressive for a 35k car. The 62k leaf managed 208miles 
 
thanks again everyone",2020,1,28
"Could perhaps start a thread in the Tesla section. My thoughts, having gone from a Leaf 24 to a Model 3 SR+: 
 
Bear efficiency in mind. Many people have been finding that the 3LR isn't as much further ranged as they'd been hoping over the SR+ because the SR+ is more efficient (240kg lighter, single motor). In simple terms the LR should be +50% range because it's +50% battery size, but it's more like +33% in the real world.  
 
Model 3s generally are rather more efficient than Model S, and an SR+ is likely to be very close to if not greather than the range of an S75D, especially once you take a few years battery degradation into account on the S75D. Model 3 also has new AP hardware and faster charging than S75D - those were among my reasons for choosing model 3 over a used S (which for a long time I'd preferred).  
 
With the SR+ a 70 mile each way commute (ie two cold starts) could be getting a bit close to the limit in the depths of winter, depending on the types of roads, your driving, etc. For that reason, and if you're looking at buying the car yourself (rather than leasing) and wanting to keep it a longer time then the LR is probably the better choice in your case - with the SR+ you might be pushing the battery to 100% rather too often. For 50 mile each way I'd not hesitate on the SR+.  
 
The Model 3 drives in a different league to the Leaf, and to many cars that I've had or driven. I find it epically entertaining personally, but many ""petrolheads"" decry it as ""boring"" - largely without having driven one. I will preface this by saying that I've not driven a Golf R specifically, but... The Model 3 chassis is extraordinarily capable. Of course, physics is very much on its side thanks to the low centre of gravity and placement of the vast majority of the weight inside the wheelbase (no heavy engine hanging out the front, etc) and the suspension is extremely good - it delivers immense grip and instantaneous responsiveness and performance - no lagging turbos, waiting for downshifts, etc. Ultimately it's a matter of what you enjoy about driving and with a Golf R I'm sure you have clear ideas what that is - you won't get the mechanical symphony of a good ICE sports car, but you will get a car that allows you to enjoy the road in a purer way (think go-kart - no gears, blank out the noise, just concentrate on the apexes, your line, the grip. In the model 3 you can even hear the tyres load up as you lean on them in a way that's pretty much always hidden in an ICE). The model 3 is rewarding and fun, if not necessarily in the exact same way as an ICE. Whether you would find it a satisfying replacement for the Golf R (rather than a complement to it as the Leaf would be) would be down to you, but I recommend a test drive    
 
The model S is nothing like as engaging as a back-road blaster. It is, however, probably a better motorway cruiser in terms of ride and noise, and since many of your miles are that then that might be a consideration.",2020,1,29
"Hi i-s, 
thank you for the explanation about the M3 thats very interesting. I was rather concerned about the bump in price £38k to £47k ouch. I really do love my R I went for the DSG because I'm lazy but the cost of driving 100 miles per day will be prohibitive probably £60+ per week. I have driven a S and my friend has one I like it but hopefully no one flames me it reminds me of a Mercedes E class which I had for a fortnight. The (Tesla S) are just too darn big for me, like a boat but a really comfy fast boat, something that big should not move that quick

"Sounds about right, I found the S has a very similar on the road feel to our Lexus GS, so comparisons to an E class are entirely unsurprising. The 3 is certainly a much tauter car, but I find it much more comfortable than M-Sport BMWs.

"Yes, standard AP.  
 
In traffic queues it's outstandingly good.

However, it is much more aware of things around it than those systems, and it is improving continuously - unlike any other car I've had where the faults are just things you choose to live with or not I am entirely confident that TACC/AP will improve on the Model 3. They already have improved significantly since we got the car in august, and more to come. This is an area where the model 3 will prove better over time than a used S that might be AP2. AP3 development has already forked from AP2 (eg AP3 recognises and displays traffic cones, AP2 does not).",2020,1,29
"Doing the math on my R the car is worth about £23k I will save about £2500-3000 a year on petrol. So over lets say 3 years I should save £7.5k That gets me to £30k still £8k short. 
As you said the £47k one is an even bigger shortfall £17k 
 
As you can see I'm still very undecided the Golf R luckily really do keep their value a 2014 will still go for over £15k. I made sure mine was the 306bhp version too which will improve the price. 
 
I keep going back to the 1.0L Picanto sitting on my drive doing nothing   I do like the Model 3 but financially I do think wait until they become used. Sell my R invest the £23k ",2020,1,29
"I think that supply and demand means that used model 3 aren't going to be ""cheap"" any time soon. I think we're probably 2 years off SR+ breaking the 30k barrier.  
 
However, to take Sandy and your points - depreciation is indeed usually one of the biggest ownership costs of any car. We bought a 2011 Volvo V70 when it was 2 and a bit years old and sold it at 8 years old, 46000 miles later. Fuel cost averaged around 15p/mile, depreciation cost 24p/mile. My used leaf was about 3p/mile to fuel and 2.8p/mile in depreciation. The Picanto at 8-10p per mile on fuel will be competitive in cost since the capital is already sunk.",2020,1,29
"Hi Sandy, 
yes I saw that Zoe when I was leading through a list of EV's price is certainly right. Seems the sweet spot for the range is about 50kWh its a shame the Leaf EV+ is so expensive and thus into the model 3 territory.",2020,1,30
"As an aside- best deal I ever got was 2 fiat 500's for £20, made one out of 2 and sold it after 8 years for £180.....",2020,1,30
"The USA car market is somewhat different to ours though - historically new cars have been cheap and used cars expensive in the USA compared to here - for example, a 10 year old Honda Accord with 80k miles on it runs just under $10k in the USA, whilst I got £2k for mine here in the UK.  
 
I think we are, as gjweston said, into a period of time where EVs will be relatively low on depreciation and ICE will be even higher. As the march of anti-ICE and particularly anti-diesel sentiment continues and is solely a one-way street of public opinion then think about where public opinion and demand will be in 3 years time then you have to think that trying to flog a 3-year old G20 320d is going to be tricky! In the meantime, while supply on EVs will improve, I think used demand will be strong for what few used EVs there are.",2020,1,30
"Wow soupdragon, 
that's some interesting figures as you said the X6 depreciation is flattening out after 3 years but the Tesla is still beating it hands down. I take it back about the luxury ICE free fall happening in a few years its happened. 
 
So buy a model 3 lower running costs, much lower deprecation and the residual will be very good in 3 years.I suppose that will hold for other EV's though.",2020,1,30

"Just been looking at the number of EV sales (all types). In 2014 the percentage of new cars that were EV's was 0.59%. In March this year it was 1.37%.

"Originally I was intending to keep it at least 10 years. Unfortunately, my calculations didn’t include a doubling of electricity costs. In 2021 the £30k ev car, on the mileage I do, would have saved at least £15k in fuel costs over the 10 years. Take that saving away and I’m in a £30k car that costs as much to run as my old £5k ice. 
Before anybody says there are less maintenance costs, that is only true to a degree. On this car, tyres are more expensive and wear quicker, less garages are able to work on them, long term reliability of non Chevys, Teslas and Leaf’s is still unknown. I was prepared to take the maintenance gamble as I figured even a £5k+ major unplanned repair would still have affordable over the 10 year plan, but not now.",2022,10,9
"I can and do charge at home, but that is also more expensive than it was. 
My point is as Monkeyhanger suggested, I am a private buyer doing 20k miles a year, who could venture into £30k car territory as the fuel cost savings made it viable. Run a £30k ev with low electricity costs or run a £5k to £10 k ice with higher fuel costs. It pretty much amounted to the same cost per month so I went EV because they’re better for the environment and well, just better, right ? 
Now, it’s a different world and the ice car I could afford cash only uses fuel if I move it and has a massive already established support structure. 
My car now would cost even more to buy today than when I got it, which hurts the equation for anybody similar to me thinking about moving to EV. 
In terms of Are EV Sales Doubling Every Year ? I think they will certainly slow down now.",2022,10,9
Do you have a cheap overnight tariff I know Octopus has gone from 5p to 7.5p overnight for some but it's still way cheaper than petrol or diesel if you can do all of your charging at home it would be over £2000 a year saved.,2022,10,9

If you want to reliably and reasonably easily traverse our country in an ev then you will be on InstaVolt, IONITY, Osprey, Gridserve etc and that is best case of £0.66/kWh. I disregard the time to charge as after 150 miles or so I want a rest but unfortunately a 3 to 5 year old Leaf or Ionic adds in extra stops which then mean more time on your day. A 3 to 5 year old 45mpg ice estate car is effectively the same cost for me to run on these journeys and a third of the money taken up to just have it when stood on the drive. 
Hence I don’t think ev sales will double.",2022,10,9
"Surely the biggest thing here is can you charge at home, if you have to fully rely on public chargers then yes the numbers are different. When I went EV I had to change the car anyway, I could have bought a cheap (er) petrol/diesel but with 99% home charging the annual savings made the choice a bit of a no brainer. Yes, the initial cost was higher but then the driving experience is at a higher level also. Sometimes you cannot make a direct comparison, what is important to you.",2022,10,9
"Went to Eastbourne and back in the Zoe this weekend, 653 miles, 150Kwh of electricity, cost me £48 in public charging. Same journey in my old Dirty Diesel Fiesta would have cost £1.86 per litre of Diesel divided by 10 miles range per litre = £0.186 x 653 = £121.46. 
 
Diesel would have to drop to £0.73 a litre for price parity with an EV. 
 
Still cheaper to run an EV, apart from the difficulty of publicly charging on Type 2 AC, but that's another story 😄",2022,10,11

Gaz",2022,3,31
"This doesn't answer the actual question though. They still get lower distance out of compatible battery sizes (optimistic WLTP rating or not). 
 
So what are they doing differently? Poor motor design, weight, aero, BMS, rolling resistance and internal friction?",2022,3,31
"My guess is that it’s because it’s very much first generation for them. Essentially they have one motor and two batteries across their range including vans as far as I can see. 
It’s interesting that their Stelantis sibling Fiat seems to have a more efficient package for the 500, but that was developed before the merger. I’m guessing their second generation product will take quite a leap forward.",2022,3,31
I expect they contain used Leaf 30kw batteries.... ,2022,3,31
"I think there's several things at play here: 
 
 
 they mention gross battery capacity, not net. So it's 50kWh, but only 42-46kWh usable, depending on various factors. Comparing with other cars which have 50kWh usable is not correct. 
 as mentioned above, they seem to be more sensitive to temperature, in that they lock out a piece of the available energy. This is because, apparently, there's no active battery heating (but, rather, only active cooling), as opposed to some competitors 
 with the exception of the e208, all their models are weird CUVs. Not good for aerodynamic efficiency 
  
However, under ideal conditions (~20 degrees Celsius, ~70kmph / 50mph avg speed), I'm sure I can hit the WLTP claimed range of 350km. Is this really very different vs. other manufacturers?",2022,3,31
But surely they should be advertising net capacity not gross in that case? It's a bit misleading.,2022,3,31
It is advertised (in the UK at least) as 45kWh usable on the Pegeot variants; but I pulled out of buying an e-2008 because despite repeated test drives and plenty of advice   I couldn't get better than 3 miles / kWh which is just not good enough for my usage given teh small usable capacity.,2022,3,31
"I'm also concerned that battery SOH seems to be dropping quite rapidly on these cars too from what I've read? 
 
The attractive prospect that's even caused me to look into these is that they are pretty much the cheapest, new EV available at this moment in time.",2022,3,31
"Please remember that the new 2022 made 50Kw Citroen, Pug and Vx cars have some tech changes to give them a better range. (Corsa-e went from 207 to 222 miles). I have seen no trade/media reviews covering the range of the 2022 models. There is a report from a new owner, a couple of days ago in the Corsa-e forum, where they have just got 199 miles on a long use. Seems pretty good to me. 
 
There are starting to be a few owners of the 2022 version cars and, hopefully, they will confirm the range of the 2022 revised models. 
 
Totally agree on the price - The Corsa-e (waiting for ours to arrive) does look very good value - If you pick up the lower prices from some dealers.",2022,3,31
"The early ones had fairly poor heat pumps and HVAC systems as well as I understand no battery heating only battery cooling. Moreover as already stated they are a 45kw battery in reality. I believe however the December 22 version has a noticeably better range due to new heat pump, new HVAC system and potentially a mildly higher geared motor IIRC plus various software tweaks. 
 
The Peugeot and Corsa occupy 9th/10th in efficiency averages according to EVDB which seems pretty good to me. My folks Mokka-e has consistently been hovering around the 3.7kwh mark over last few days with a few up into 4.0kwh during the middle of the day. 
 
My experience on the ground is largely that the poor range claims are unfounded save perhaps for the motorway in winter where the range was definitely impacted. I’m hoping very much to explore that when my updated Corsa turns up.",2022,3,31
I would assume if I test drove one of the Stellantis cars they would be the pre-patched/pre-tweaked versions?,2022,3,31
"The platform of these cars is not pure electric. It's the same platform for ICE, Hybrid and EV variants. That means that probably some compromises have been made, making these cars less efficient than EV specific platforms (e.g. VW ID.3, Hyundai Ioniq 5, etc...) 
 
I think that even the Fiat 500 is an EV only platform, so it might be more efficient (other than the size/weight differences mentioned here). 
 
The heat pump on pre 2022 models is pretty useless: it doesn't heat up like a PTC heater but still consumes alot of energy (I have seen above 3kw consumption difference, between idle without heating on, and with it on, measured with and OBD device). 
 
As for winter: maybe the battery needs some better insulation. I have seen a big difference in range between summer and winter even without using heating (yes, I drive with my coat on 🥶). 
 
The WLTP range is always measured in ideal 25°C temperatures, so that could explain some of the differences.",2022,3,31
"Can't have an efficiency discussion without mentioning the Korean vehicles can we... One thing I have noticed is incredibly low HVAC power requirements - even on non-heat-pump models. Though a heat pump equipped e-niro I drove 200 miles this week with the heating on the entire time reckoned HVAC power draw was 0% of energy usage after 180 miles of driving. I forgot to take a photo when I got back and the display seems to reset after charging so I can't prove it! Even boosting in the morning when cold it seems to rarely draw more than 2kW. My previous Chevrolet Volt/Ampera used to draw 7kW when heating the cabin from cold. Similarly despite the size of the e-niro it genuinely does seem to achieve far higher efficiency than comparable cars, though the 64kWh (net) battery helps.",2022,3,31
So which of the Stellantis cars do we feel is the most aerodynamic?,2022,3,31
"Forget WLTP rating. 3 miles/kWh is a decent figure for this type of design and weight. For more efficiency, 
 
 
 The car's front must be a bit sharper without grills to improve the drag co-efficient 
 The car must scavenge heat to help during cold weather 
 The motor, gear and powertrain must be designed for efficiency

"It is interesting to watch the evolution from the S to Y. There is more complexity but also better integration.  
 
 
One of the reasons I decided to lease instead of buy the i3S was complex cooling system. There are two separate liquid cooling loops and they use different coolant. The battery pack is cooled by a third direct expansion loop.  
 
The Y has a single radiator at the front of the car.. Everything uses that through a set of valves and cold plates.

Good for them. 
 
I was expecting to see a complicated working fluid assembly but it looks like that aspect is a stand alone heat pump side (presumably AC is a separate pump elsewhere) and then water is the thermal carrier via heat exchangers. That's how I'd make it ... so I can't knock it!!   
 
If they make that whole assembly moderately easy to remove and replace, i.e. the computer will say  'replace all of THAT' , if it ever becomes a fault issue, then they take the whole lump out and swap it, recondition the part, etc..

It is top of the range with every possible toy including: full glass roof that can be darkened with a touch of a button. Heated door and central armreasts, heated and ventilated sets, HUD and the list goes on and on.

"Had to the bite the bullet and go full EV as the Zoe is getting a bit too wheezy to be relied on to do 24,000 miles per year! That's too high a mileage to be able to keep the car for a long time, so we decided to add a second EV so that it shares the load. Second car usage is currently much lower, so the combined mileage is 30,000 and the shared load will be 15,000 per year, which hopefully the Zoe will cope with. 
 
Decided the Soul was our best option in terms of £/kWh of battery, as we needed the best range we could afford since we are giving up the ICEV range comfort blanket. 
 
Found a nice 10 month old top-spec Soul, should get it by end of Feb all being well. Have to say it's massively solid feeling car, bit like a big Jeep. Aiming to keep it for 7 years or so, so having 6 years of warranty is a good feeling too.",2023,2,20

For someone paying £589 for an ID3, with low insurance premiums, almost exclusively charging at home, only getting 1 or 2 referrals (if any) then, yeah, probably seems expensive.",2022,3,3

Delivery or collection will increase from £99.50 to £129.50. 
Swapping a car will increase from £49.50 to £79.50. 
 
That means if you book a delivery, collection or swap before 1st Dec, you will pay the current price, regardless of the delivery date.

When I come back and apply does anyone know if that will be an issue? Has anyone here ever replied with a blank record like that? Looking at the eligibility criteria, it might be OK? 
 
I could just ask them, but I´d rather not draw attention to the issue by asking, I´d rather just apply not mentioning it.",2023,5,9

But that is a good £800 - £1200 repair non insurance and more like £3k to put through the insurance",2022,4,13
It depends on what you might want a car for.. but in my experience taking the money and buying a more modern car has the benefit that you are likely to get more for your car as a write off than trading it in. Yes it is a perfectly nice car before it got damaged but when negotiating with the claims people ask them to find an exact same car in your area that was in the condition yours was in.

"Well exactly, so it's generally easier to reverse into the space, given its narrower and requires more accuracy, with the additional manoeuvrability offered by ""rear wheel steering"". 
 
Additionally, when exiting the space, you have far better visibility of your surroundings if you have reversed in. If accidents are going to happen, it's when reversing out into a roadway with poor visibility. 
 
Each to their own of course, but interestingly I've seen several car parks mandate reverse parking, but never the opposite.",2021,10,31
A central rear charge port door is the best (never seen one though) then a central front one. Wouldn’t choose to buy a car with a side door - but it sadly appears to be getting more common.,2021,10,31
"My preference has always been to reverse into a parking space. Generally you get it right first time and don't have to pull back out to centre yourself, something that I often see with people who go straight in. Pulling out forwards affords far more visibility than reversing out, especially if you have a high sided vehicle next to you. My car has handy door mirrors and a reversing camera to aid reversing in. Having said that I almost reversed into someone yesterday who ignored a no entry sign in a car park and tried to go behind me as I was reversing! I spotted him just in time. 
 
I wish they had changed the side of the charging port on the ID.3 to the nearside on UK ID.3's. There are quite a few chargers appearing on the side of the road near me which I can't use as the cables aren't long enough and it's not possible to turn around to get to them.",2021,11,1

From the <16mph impact, it damaged the wheel carrier, so the wheel bearing etc. needs replacing. Crossmember, can't test it, so needs replacing. Subframe, can't test it, so that's going to the scrap man too! 
 
The Steering rack needs replacing because the damage caused to the wheel carrier... and because the rack needs replacing, BMW recommend replacing everything up to and including the steering column

I'm traveling back to the dear old UK this summer and I was looking for a rental car normally I would just go for the cheapest shed and be done with it ..  
However its seem that the Hertz had a deal and it's cheaper than a flat 500  
 
On the site it say's polestar 2 * ( or Similar) whats the similar ? 
 
I'm wondering about the charging network I haven't been in the UK for 8 years or so and charging wasn't good has it got better ? 
Also cost as it seems they have an arrangement with shell but I can't find any rates

Glasgow City Council are now charging for chargeplace Scotland, which was free before, and commercial ones have rocketed up in price in the last few months - you've probably heard about energy costs going crazy, but are still comparable to petrol costs. You can save money by signing up to several apps, lowering the unit price in exchange for a monthly fee. Depending how long you're staying for, and how much you care about price vs convenience, it may not be worth it - most new chargers can take contactless payments, and Apple/Google/Samsung Pay is better than contactless cards, since they authenticate every transaction by fingerprints, face, or pin, they have no limit. Standard cards have a £100 limit, and every so often ask for a pin - which you can't enter in most chargers with no keypad, so the charge will fail.",2023,5,6

They have webpage that you can pay as you go and they are a lot cheaper than the major providers. However, bear in mind that they don't have many 50kW chargers.  
One other important thing to be aware with Hertz is that they give you a car with minimum of 80% charge and you have to return the car with the same.

"To my mind if you are going to sell a BEV it should be designed from the ground up and not shoe horned into an existing design. BEV's need less bonnet, just enough for a crumple zone to protect the occupants and battery. A re-design allows for better utilisation of the length of the vehicle. To fit a large battery it needs to go under most of the car between the wheels. fitting it into a drive shaft tunnel and the space where a fuel tank would fit is always going to be a compromise. I therefore think they are absolutely right to design a new model. The MEB platform gives them a strong starting point to electrify the vast majority of their cars.",2019,10,28
Don't assume all cars made on the ID.3 platform will have the same shaped roof/backend. The platform has a 20 year design life.,2019,10,28
"The problem legacy OEMs have is how to transition from fossil fuel to electric. Legacy platforms are expensive to make fully electric and you comprise the design advantages. All manufacturers will (eventually) move from their compromised approach (Peugeot 208, Mini, Golf, etc) to dedicated EV platforms (such as MEB) in time, they will just do it at different stages.  
 
It is widely believed VW made no money on eGolf (especially after sunk costs) but did it to keep within EU emissions limits and to gain experience of electric cars. PSA are only now doing with the e208 what VW did with the eGolf, probably because their needs to reduce emissions only became an issue in the post 2020 landscape.  
 
With a dedicated EV platform we can go back to RWD (with optional AWD) and get the benefits that brings, enhanced by the EV packaging and cab forward designs we see in iPace, ID3, etc. VW will be taking advantage of that over other manufacturers as they introduce new models on the platform.  
 
Bear in mind that (at best) in 2020 VW will have less than 5% of their production as BEV. Therefore, they do not want to create widespread demand for electric vehicles they can not fufil as it would hurt their revenue and profits. In the Golf size class they will mainly sell fossil fuel Golf MK8 and try to woo just  sufficient  people to the ID3 initially. As production shifts more to electric, they will introduce cheaper ID3 models to attract more customers and then introduce other variants. It is complex and difficult...",2019,10,28

Surely the point about the ID is that it is based on VWs totally new chassis/drivetrain/battery assembly which has been nicknames The Skateboard on which they have spent a big chunk of their 30 billion euro investment in EVs. They have licensed the skateboard to other EV manufacturers which will gain some recompense for the massive investment but in terms of their own EV range the basic chassis is scaleable and will allow different body configurations. Hardly compares with a converted Golf does it?,2019,10,29
I don't think the ID3 needs to worry about the eGolf until the ID3 actually exists.,2019,10,29
"I really like the look of the ID3 but by the time I change cars I hope there’ll be more choice of smaller cars, which are likely to meet my needs better in a few years. I won’t need to change cars for ages though because the e-Golf is really good. When I got it, one of the big attractions of it was that it’s just a Golf. I looked at the Leaf (ugly and not comfortable to sit in) and the Zoe (felt wrong for my lengthy commute) but the Golf appealed much, much more. The fact that it just felt right to sit in and great to drive was partly down to it being so normal. 
 
I don't want a flashy car and I don’t want a fast car; I want a car that drives well, feels comfortable and scores well in safety tests. I want I car I can park. I want a car that is practical: it needs to be easy to get in and out of and hold shopping or luggage. It needs to get me a reasonable distance but I don’t see the point in weighing it down with a huge battery pack for those very occasional longer trips (I’ll be stopping for coffee anyway so charging isn’t really time consuming). 
 
All in all, the e-Golf suits me really well. In the future I’m sure there will be cars built from the start as EVs that suit my needs perfectly (depending on what I need at the time, I like the look of the Honda e and the ID3) but the fact that my car wasn’t doesn’t seem like an impediment.",2019,10,29
"Why unlikely? The current mini, beetle, and 500 noly have general shape in common with the initial ones. That's even true of the golf. I'm sure they can make a car that looks as similar to a golf as the current mini is similar to the original on just about any chassis.",2019,10,30
"For me, going EV should have given manufacturers the freedom/opportunity to re-imagine the packaging of cars. 
 
I'm actually really underwhelmed with Tesla. The model S is stylish enough and could be any of the big 4 door coupe style cars from any of the prestige makers but the model 3 could be any Korean/Japanese, even dare I say it Chinese maker. It's totally inoffensive but I find it bland. Take the gull wing doors of the X and it too is a tad boring. 
 
I know the general buying public are to a fault conservative and manufacturers with large volume plans need to sell to the heart of the market but it's all a bit soulless. 
 
I'm old enough to remember Ford getting a kicking for daring to replace the Cortina with the jelly mould Sierra and then the Mondeo ( which feeds into the FWD/RWD debate - the Mondeo being superior in every possible metric!!) 
 
When Fiat stepped waaaay outside the box with the brilliant but fugly Multipla they too found the general public unimpressed and a genius car got a short lifespan. Interestingly enough the conceptually similar Honda FRV also failed to sell well.  
 
The original Merc A class which had the potential to be one of the few cars which should have led beautifully to an EV version with its skate board chassis got ruined due to the elk test. I doubt that any other supermini at the time would have fared much better but that got lost in the noise and another manufacturer got slammed for some original thinking. 
 
The only volume EV which dared to be different, the BMW i3, has up thread been rated as inferior in most ways to what ostensibly should be a far more compromised EV, the eGolf. 
To be fair, you are comparing a car in its 7th iteration, with all the conceptual refinement that brings, which is widely regarded as the best in its class, to a car daring to be different. VW have had 40 years to hone the Golf package to appeal/appease to the very heart of the car market at the price point it competes at. 
The i3  should  be the better EV but you would expect the Golf to tick a lot more boxes as a car. 
 
On the FWD/RWD debate I am sort of uniquely positioned to comment as I drive both in the one car, BMW 225xe. Except in reality it has the best/worst of both and unquestionably it drives best as a 4WD. The handling of the car is dominated by its weight rather than its driven wheels. Yes I can notice some torque steer if I cane it but in reality it's excess weight makes it a point and squirt machine, not one you balance on the throttle through a bend. I don't have a bias here having grown up (and rallied!!) on RWD but mostly owned FWD. They both have their merits, it's just been rare to have a FWD where handling was a top priority. FWIW One of the best handling cars of all time was the FWD Lotus Elan which was essentially replaced by one of the other best handling cars of all time, the RWD Elise. 
 
Which brings me back to EV packaging. There really shouldn't be any debate, a skateboard chassis with 4 motors will give the best dynamics in terms of weight distribution and torque vectoring. Neither FWD nor RWD will be able to compete with that if they make handling a priority. 
 
Now if they would only be brave enough to put something smart on top of the skateboard ?",2019,11,1

"Tesla had lots of scrutiny of their ramp up of production of the model X and model 3. Presumably as they were keen to sell the cars and improve their cash flow. I'm sure that if they had had the choice they would have preferred to keep their ramp up private and kept the production problems that arose private. Remember that there were quite a lot of quality issues reported with the early cars that have now been sorted out. VW are starting out with 30 cars a day, No doubt this will give them more opportunity to check the product during production and refine the production process before they reach showrooms and customers. They are talking of reaching good volumes by the end of the first quarter of next year which will then give them enough volume to meet the 1st edition orders in a timely way. Ideally VW want to demand to meet or just slightly exceed production. If the waiting list is too long consumer will consider alternatives. 
 
I'm more than happy not to be on the waiting list for a first edition, and have more choice and probably better offers later.",2019,11,5
"When I watched the LONG launch video of the ID3 ( nearly dozed off a one point ) the CEO of VW clearly stated it was there intension to start producing cars to be ""Stored"" very soon. 
He said it was there intension to be able to supply ID3's to customers who had placed orders AND people entering the show room as soon as possible after the release of the car in spring / summer 2020. 
This differs from other manufactures who build a small number of EV's for the launch, then make customers wait a LONG time for there cars. e.g. E.Niro. 
It looks like VW wants to buck this trend by getting a lot of the ID3 cars to hit the road as soon after launch as they can. 
If you would like to go through the video again ( OH NO ! ) he was clear with regards to this statement. 
Let's see if they can come good with their commitment ????.",2019,11,5

"The Leafs have a 1 pedal mode which works very well and you do realise that this mode on all EVs also uses the friction brakes to stop the car. Regen braking can only slow it. 
 
Brake light illumination depends on the rate of retardation and this means both on non 1 pedal and 1 pedal modes. 
On my 62kw Leaf they came on when the regeneration exceeded about 75%.",2022,2,1
"AFAIK, all EVs have regen braking, at least I've not driven one that doesn't. It's more powerful in some than others, some have variable regen settings and some will limit regen when the battery is cold, or fully charged. 
 
All cars are required to have brake lights that come on at a set deceleration rate now, I believe. This means that if regen is high then the brake lights will come on at about the same point that they would if the friction brakes were slowing the car.",2022,2,1
Just curious - some reviews I’ve seen talk about paddles or buttons to adjust the regen. Do they usually remember that setting so you can set and forget? In my Tesla it just has the one mode so there isn’t anything to change so wondered how other cars do it,2022,2,1
Leafs have a switch for e-Pedal so it's on all the time. Cars like the EV6/Ioniq 5 have their own I-Pedal but it needs to be set every time ,2022,2,1
"Hyundai / Kia have 4 regen levels, from coasting (0) to serious deceleration (3).

Honda E has one pedal mode. Don't know whether it saves the setting between powering off and back on.,2022,2,1
"Fiat 500e has one pedal driving mode, rarely need to touch the brake pedal at all, once you get used to it. The regen level is preset, no adjustment possible ( not that I have found in the settings anyway)",2022,2,1
"Every modern EV has regenerative braking. 
 
Most but not all can be adjusted in how aggressive that regen is. The Ioniq 5 has four levels as an example. 
 
This is usually done by flicking a button but in some fancier cars flappy paddle. 
 
Some cars will remember the setting, some will go back to a default eg 1(min), 2, 3(max) and defaults back to 2. 
 
Some cars the regen will bring the car to a complete halt whilst others will bring it down to crawling at <5mph and you'll need to put your foot on the brake to actually bring it to a stop.",2022,2,1
Does the auto-hold use the friction brakes when using max gen and coming close to a halt or does it only engage the friction brakes once you come to a stop ?,2022,2,1
"The Enyaq (and I presume the ID3 and ID4) doesn't have 1 pedal. It has regen (and auto regen as you near roundabouts and junctions etc), and it has auto-hold but you still need the foot brake to stop before the auto-hold engages.",2022,2,1
"Isn't it just the Leaf that has true one pedal driving?.. Perhaps the latest Kia/Hyundai do too but I think a lot of cars have a strong regen mode that gets called ""one pedal"". I've heard the Zoe B mode referred to as ""one pedal driving"" which it absolutely isn't.  
 
On our e-Niro in level 3 regen, or the Zoe in B-Mode you can do most of your driving without touching the brake pedal. However when actually needing to stop, the brake pedal is required. Both cars creep like a traditional automatic. It's notable the regen on the Kia is much 'stronger' than the Zoe and it always takes me a moment to re-adjust when swapping between them, so not all cars will feel the same. 
 
I haven't driven a Leaf but my work did try a Kangoo EV demonstrator with one pedal mode and I loved it. No creep, came to a standstill by automatically, gently, applying the friction brakes. Showed the brake lights as you'd expect. Really what all EVs should have and I find it baffling that they don't.",2022,2,1
"The Leafs E-pedal is indeed a true 1pedal mode because the accelerator will apply the brakes to add to the regen if you lift off completely. I.e. the friction brakes are not just used to stop you completely. 
 
(It's easy to compare max retardation, foot off, in B with 1-pedal - there's a big difference due to the friction brakes) 
I used e-pedal most of the time because locally, I had to either slow down to <10mph or stop at a junction and using B would have also required foot on the brake pedal.",2022,2,1

Personally I'd be happy with Fast chargers at Lidls but Rapids are a bonus as long as the costs are reasonable I'll use them for sure.",2017,1,16
By far the biggest problem with supermarket carpark locations is the lack of priority given by local management to the bay blocking issues. I realise that locating them close to where power supplies are can be the cheapest option. And that typically that is right by the front door. But it is also totally the wrong place. Rapids need to be in the most unpopular parking area there. And even then have totally over the top signs and floor markings to try to make it obvious what they are there for. Clearly this will cost a lot initially to lay 3 phase cables that distance but anything other than that would be to create endless problems for the store management and potential customers alike. As part of initial installation costs it must be factored in or it will be regretted fairly soon.,2017,1,16

Looks like its gone the way of the e-citigo ",2020,12,3
"It wouldn’t surprise me, if only for the reason that VW won’t benefit from EVs sold in the UK next year so no whole range emissions benefits. 
 
Whilst they’ll supply the volume stuff (ID.3/4 etc), there can‘t be much of a case for a slow seller like the e-Up! to be built in sufficient numbers in RHD form to make it a profitable exercise?",2020,12,3
"As above, they are probably going to focus e-Up sales on LHD mainland Europe so they count towards EU Emissions in 2021. I suspect the Fiat 500 would have sold a lot better than it anyway as a more modern EV, be interesting to see how many Fiat make available for UK Market, orders open early 2021.",2020,12,3
What a shame its a great car. I had a petrol up before my Egolf and it was a lovely little runabout.,2020,12,3
"I was sorry to hear this. Our first EV was an e-Up! and (apart from the first day driving it 200 miles home with most EH CCS sockets being incompatible ! ) it was a great little car. We initially bought it for use only as a 'shopping trolley' but after the first few weeks tended to use it for all journeys under 60 miles (which was about 9 out of 10 days). We decided to upgrade to something with a longer range so that we could pension off our oil burner. 
 
An e-Golf would have been first choice - until our friendly local VW salesman refused to take the e-Up! in part exchange and 'advised' us that an EV was completely unsuitable for us (in spite of us having had one for 2+ years   ). Hence the Nissans.",2020,12,3
It's still available in Yorkshire where it's called the Eh-Up,2020,12,4
"Greetings from the south of France.  
 
Here what were told when I tried to get the 3rd e-UP (we have had two over 6 years): that the rebates in Germany and elsewhere maxed the orders to delivery timeplines. As I understood, the range of the car thanks to the 32kw pack went up, and the price down (plus rebtes). Apparently in Germany, the price was compelling enough to make the delivery time up to 16 months out as they got a rush of orders. Probably they never anticipated some number of production, as the e-UP was not like a best seller previously.  
 
I had other stores about the Zwickau plant vs Slovakia and the ""need or desire"" to refactor production over to the ID lines. I spoke to the EV ""expert"" (means sales person) and EV mechanic (only 2 in this region). So, messing up the stories, it seems not likely to see any ""configurable"" e-UPs in 2021. But, there are always ""plated"" cars (somebody registered it) around in France. So, I think we might find something like that next year if there are any around with all the options.  
 
In the end, I was offered some of the demo units that are sitting around France on dealer lots and a lot of pressure to go with the ID3 as well. The latter is no good for the parking around here, even the e-Golf was a bit bigger and the e-UP has always been good for us in the city. We have considered a Zoe or the e-208....both have their own set of complications, like renting batteries in one case    
 
So, we will run this one (current e-UP) into the ground and wait to see if other models appear in the next couple years. My best guess is VW is just not ""currently"" looking into the small compact city dweller market and believes mainstream is best. Probably the numbers work that way. However, my view is 80% of the people that live an Uraban life, probably could do fine with a 200km range car. Besides, it usually is parked 80% of the time.

They did their group test on the Ami. Which was hilarious as VBH nearly tipped it over at 10 mph so it has some serious stability issues. 
 
There was also this interesting crowd funded EV that was supposed to be around £25k that had solar panels all over it.  
 
They took the Kia EV6 around Germany and took it on the AutoBahn.  
 
They did an EV Electric vs Petrol test with the Corsa E showing the electric one cheaper. . This was with petrol at only 1.30 odd a litre as well not the 1.50 odd it's around now. A 4 year PCP was used as the TCO with average mileage of 7500 miles a year.

Maybe an ensemble show about EVs could do with more than one EV fan, but Rory is one of my favourite car reviewers. 
 
I think the format does expose how few EVs are being made with an emphasis on fun, though.

Battery swaps with Nio - how many extra batteries would you need and how many battery swap places? Seems crackers to me.",2022,1,21
"Tesla demoed battery swapping in 2013 where it took 90 seconds to swap a model S battery. They abandoned the idea a couple of years later after only a handful of people took up the option and concentrated on expanding their supercharger network instead. From what I can remember there were only a couple of sites in California where you could swap batteries and imagine the infrastructure costs would have been very high, so,limiting the number of sites which won’t have helped take up. I can see Nio hitting exactly the same problems and will no doubt abandon it in a couple of years. Th cynical part of me thinks it’s just a PR stunt to try and promote Nio in markets that have never heard of the company. 
 
in terms of Norway car prices there’s more than just a VAT saving as I think there’s a sliding scale based on emissions too. For example the cheapest BMW M3 starts at 1,108,900 NOK (about £92,300) while the Tesla model 3 performance is 499,900 NOK (£41,600). We even see that within manufacturers with the base Porsche 911 starting at 1.5m NOK, which isn’t that much less than the Taycan Turbo S (1.68m NOK). As an aside the Nio ES8 prices goes from 519,000 NOK to 769,000 NOK (about £43,200 to £64,000) so will be quite expensive with 20% VAT in the UK.",2022,1,22

I’ve done some digging and it looks like Nio has a battery swap network of about 700 sites in China and has done 3 million battery swaps, so do know what they are doing. From what I can work out they were planning four sites for Norway by the end of last year and guess they have at least one as Fifth Gear showed. They also offer battery rental much like the Zoe and Leaf did but it about £100 a months for the 70kWh battery and £150 for the 100kWh battery, though this does reduce the cost of the car by £7,500 and £13,000 depending on battery.",2022,1,23
"@Foucault  
 
The cost to swap batteries for a fully charged one wasn't mentioned either.",2022,1,23
You get six free swaps a month as part of the battery rental or battery as a service as Neo calls it and from what I can work out two swaps a month if you buy the car outright. Those include 600kWh and 200kWh of electricity for rental/bought battery so effectively including the price of charging into the battery swap. I couldn’t work out whether the European price would have the 80 yuan a month (about £9.30) battery warranty price that they have in China if you buy the car outright. I also couldn’t work out what happens if you need more swaps or whether you could save unused ones for big trip. It’s definitely an interesting business model and can see it appealing to those who have to rely on public charging or for long trips where you end up stopping where you can charge rather than where you may want to stop.,2022,1,23
"The model Y segment was odd. Being able to change the steering wheel quickly isn’t a big deal unless you’re a motoring journalise swapping seats all the time. I’d much rather the benefit of having the steering wheel auto adjust to each driver once set up, than the manual adjustments in other cars. Agree on things being buried in the controls though

"I find the program really isn't for converts, but also doesn't really help those looking at an EV for the first time IMO. Bit too much false drama and snippets of misinformation. 
 
The track tests are a complete waste of time. No one buys an EV to track it. Completely irrelevant. 
 
It has its place and I'm glad it's on, but there is only so much TV you can make only featuring electric cars. 
 
Once you've featured range tests, acceleration comparisons and pricing, there isn't really much left to say.

La segunda generación del Renault ZOE 2020 comienza sus pruebas,2018,10,10
"I hear you  @Sandy  But in essence the answer seems to be ""yes"" then. 
 
Forgive me for being a sceptic. VW is going to kill all other brands with electric and they have already sourced 50 years of their entire car production of batteries. Yap, yap, yap, yap. 
 
Personally I don't think Renault is going to ""have the cheese eaten from their sandwich"" as we put it here. But who knows, things are going to be extremely fluid.",2019,4,25
"I still maintain that PSA are doing what they have to with electrification for EU emissions - they aren't in it the same way as the Renault Nissan alliance. 
 
Faced with much higher costs to get into an e208 or ID, I can see many Zoe owners sticking with Renault and the new Zoe. It will be a major update to the existing, especially the interior and I suspect will be launched in September in Frankfurt for delivery early 2020.  
 
It will be interesting to see what Renault do with battery rental. Even if they keep the option I can see more Zoe being sold as a one car solution, so battery owned will probably be more popular. Dealers advise that to date most Zoe were 2nd cars. Clearly those have lower annual mileage, so rental was cost effective.",2019,4,25
"I think we do need more of the affordable EVs, rather than fewer, to get more people on board (or even to prevent me having to revert to ICE in 6 and a bit years when the Zoe runs out of extended warranty and everything second hand that isn't a gen 1 Leaf with half dead battery is upwards of £10k). The notion that Zoes will lose their affordability is troubling... 
 
I realise this is an enthusiast forum and most probably have deeper pockets here than I have, but surely many, many of the general public are in the same position as me in that their budget is a 3-6 year old car for £4-6k every now and then (stretched to 7 in this case), for other people even less, and they're not going to want to pay huge prices or have to wait until one is 10 years old and could have a 4 figure repair bill at any moment 
 
On the latter point, I suppose we might see an increasing uptake of insurance that covers electromechanical breakdown, which might resolve the 10 year 'safe' lifetime issue",2019,4,25
"I think you are under-estimating the economic concept of learning curve for industrial goods (price reduces x% with each doubling of number of items produced). And well, production is massively increasing all over the board and that most definitely includes Renault. Phones, Wind turbines, Solar panels, BEVs. As opposed to resource based goods. 
 
The only things that I see making a ZOE more expensive in the long run are:- 
 
 ""because they can"", as in, price elasticity places the overall optimum (for Renault) at a different price point. I highly doubt this and I have not seen any indication of such a strategy shift; 
 ZOE growing in capabilities faster than said learning curve effect. This of course is a natural tendency all car makers have, upping models and introducing new models at the bottom. 
  
I just can't see Renault just sitting back and let this super-fluid market evolve without them. As for affordability, the biggest thread for Renault is probably coming from China. See Phones, Wind turbines, Solar panels, .......",2019,4,25
"True on China. 
 
I'm no expert on economics and just look at smartphones since the iPhone era started (i.e. the rectangular capacitive screen type). They've steadily increased, rather than decreasing, in price - particularly in the past 5 years or so when they've skyrocketed. Why... I dunno.... no-name Chinese brands off Aliexpress are more like older prices but at a risk, and successful Chinese brands (Oneplus, Huawei) have increased in price to match their success",2019,4,25
"Apple thinks it is in the ""because we can"" league, and at the rate customers are buying their stuff I'd say they do well. I don't think people here with an iPhone would compare their coolness because of their phone with their coolness because of their ZOE   (only to be offset by the absolute price difference between the two!) 
 
I buy decent (mid spec) Android phones, for just over 100 euro's. I regard a ZOE as a ""lower mid spec"" type of car. If I compare that phone with a blackberry of say 10 years old, the price have at least halved (I think more) and the power has increased somewhere between 1 and 2 magnitudes.",2019,4,25
Any estimates on price?,2019,4,25
"If they just added faster DC charging I wouldn't mind if the range stays the same; the problem we have is how long it takes between journey legs, not how far we can go in one leg. 160 odd miles would be fine if it would charge faster on the occasions we go further. 
 
This would surely be the best way to keep the cost down while still satisfying most people who would consider a Zoe, wouldn't it? If you drive very long distances frequently then you're not likely to be looking at a Zoe anyway, so why spec the battery for those people?",2019,4,26
"Fiat: they are set. Tesla sold it's soul and it's EU sales are now registered under Fiat/Chrysler. Green washing diesels. A bit like Norway sells green electricity certificates. 
 
 @Sandy , AFAIK they sell all batteries in all markets for two years, or rent out, customers choice. The buyout is indeed limited. If I am not mistaken Germany only and the prices I have seen were ridiculous. But really, I thought we were talking about new models, so avoided the ""old"" rental discussion.",2019,4,26
"@Phil Himsworth  I agree, but the reality is the ZE40 battery. If they have a fantastic redesigned battery (or simply decide to push it harder, who cares with the so beloved battery-ownership!), all the better! No argument from me. I am surprised that with the clever packaging they don't dare push the battery above 1C, but it is what it is (right now) 
 
 @cah197  The CCS charging does not use the motor coils at all. In essence the charger is directly wired to the external charger. So a new ZOE (with the magic battery) could in theory charge 22 kW AC and 100 kW DC.",2019,4,26
"Let's get something out of the way: I do agree! 
 
However, I think we need to be super careful with this type of reasoning, because we have a serious apples/oranges risk here. 
 
1a) we know for a fact that our late model Q90 ZOE's have a 43 kW spec'd and capable charger, and by inference a battery capable of (close to) 43 kW DC intake. 
1b) We also know that this power intake is only achieved under optimal conditions, even while it has advanced temperature control. 
 
2a) we know that the ""how great it's going to be"" cars have +60 kW spec'd charging capability. I am ignoring the fact that most current CCS chargers have 50 kW capacity, because it will go up. There are 4 200 kW chargers 1.5 miles from my house. However, suddenly....... 
2b) some assume that the latter ones will automagically have none of said or other type of throttling, while at the same time knowing nearly nothing about their control system. Given that it's not Renault but actually LG that build ZOE's battery control system, I honestly think this is, in a sort of British understatement, a ""quite optimistic"" assumption. 
 
I would be careful placing your bets on the laughing stock. My own speculation is that the CCS charging ZOE will charge moderately faster, and that a lot of newcomers will disappoint in real life performance compared to paper specs. I know I have been quite the a** using the ""how great it's going to be when you get it"" (it's from an old joke about Microsoft BTW), but let's not be gullible and pretend that paper cars are real cars, or that paper cars are never spec'd in a way to simply let customers wait for ""that fantastic thing just around the corner"". 
 
The only other way to make the narrative fit in a consistent way is to assume that the current ZE40 battery system is an extremely compromised or outdated design. I have trouble wrapping my head around that assumption.",2019,4,26
"It's easy to look at the Tesla rapid charging rates and say why can't other cars match them. Well there are two limiting factors, if you have a battery half the size it can only take half the charging current. Tesla has liquid cooling with every cell in direct contact with the cooling pipe. The cells are small cylindrical cells that can transfer their heat rapidly. 
 
The Zoe uses larger prismatic cells and forced air cooling. Forced air cooling is never going to be as even and efficient as liquid cooling and the larger prismatic cells won't be able to transfer their internal heat to the air as efficiently as the cylindrical cells. This means that the charging rate will need to be further limited, it makes little sense to allow 100kW charging if you then have to really throttle it back to stop the cells getting too hot. 
 
Hopefully the 2020 Zoe will get a bit faster charging, but don't expect too much.",2019,4,27
It was the comparison with the Ioniq and the smaller battery variants of the Kona and Niro I was thinking of rather than the many artists impressions for things a couple of years out. What makes the Ioniq able to charge a smaller battery twice as fast as the Q Zoe for much longer? Surely by next year the Zoe has to be around that ballpark or it will be at risk of being left behind.,2019,4,27
"When the new all sing, all dancing new Zoe gets released, do people think battery rental will still be an option? If so, will the minimum rental tier be higher than the current £59 for the 41 kW car? I can’t affford the new one but was wondering if they might adjust the pricing for the older cars.",2019,5,14
"Given the word we're not allowed to mention, will Renault give a hoot about the relationship between UK emissions and EU targets?",2019,5,14
When it comes to EV's would that not be pointless as they don't contribute to either outside of the build process?,2019,5,15
"No idea, frankly. They're all gaming the system one way or another.",2019,5,15
"Unlikely they will reduce the older models rentals, I mean when 40 was released the earlier model hire stayed the same, and there has been no reduction for the handful of UK Fluence owner trapped into an eternity of battery hire.",2019,5,15
Given those numbers it seems to me a lot of customers are actually  choosing  to (still) rent the battery.,2019,5,16
"I love that the battery lease is still popular. It nicely brings an EV that is practical enough for use as a main and only car (at least for relatively adventurous people who don't mind the odd wait for a public charge and aren't zipping 400 miles up and down the country day in day out) within the reach of ordinary people on ordinary (or below) salaries. Second hand, anyway. Far as I see it, there are vast swathes of us who normally spend like ""up to £7k"" (dependent on how much we want to push the boat out) on a 5 year old something-or-other and aim to keep it for at least 5 years, so never dreamed we'd be able to own an EV for a decade or more. Battery lease brings the Zoe (and only 3 year old at that) into that market.  
 
Of course, it's the first owner who decides whether to buy or lease the battery and creates the initial demand so I can't speak for  why  it's still popular, but I imagine it's just a similar story slightly further up the societal food chain. And if you keep it for a shorter time than (value of battery / monthly payments) months, then it works great as an affordable way to dip your toes in. 
 
As for whether lease costs would drop, maybe the mileage would become more generous? (We can dream...) but I doubt the baseline £49 would change, as there's still £6k worth of battery that needs paying for which would take 10 years at that rate.",2019,5,16
"The irrational side of me says I should own the battery, but the sums just don't add up. For 9000 miles per year my hire rate is effectively £57 per month or £684 pa. If I keep the £5000 saved on not buying a battery in the stock market and get a return of 4.5% it would take me just under 10 years to have paid less to own the battery. I'm guessing that a 10 year old 22kWh Zoe will be virtually valueless with either an owned or hired battery as it will no longer be covered by extended warranty so it wouldn't make any difference for me to have owned or hired the battery (I will probably buy a new car before then but we might get a bigger long distance car we might keep the Zoe for commuting and for our children to learn to drive in). Renting the battery I get a better warranty and bundled road side recovery. 
 
It's been argued before that having a rented battery on an old car might increase it's value as it then has a battery warranty. I suspect the owned versions will sell for more though.",2019,5,16
"For lower mileage users the PCP with battery lease is cheaper I think. If you are a higher mileage user and need the 7500 mile lease and above I think the battery owned car is then the same monthly cost. Unlimited mileage is more expensive still. So owned is cheaper. 
 
Renault site isn't showing battery owned as even an option. Mandatory battery hire link is giving me a 404 file not found error just at the moment too.",2019,5,16
"It is starting to get tested as warranties expire and people find it costs more to repair those PEC or motor failures than they're worth. Extend that warranty, people!

"So the current (battery owned) Zoe starts from £27,820 before PICG which is quite a bit less than the eCorsa at £29,990 for entry model, but that does have more features. 
 
I suspect we will see the new Zoe increase price slightly but be below £29K. The big questions are (a) will the large discounts and finance contributions continue and (b) will they offer battery rental to make it more affordable (at low mileage) over 3/4 years?",2019,6,5

The battery health will likely be less than other cars of the same age (older battery technology with no thermal management) but if it's a runaround as you say then it's probably more than fine. The older generation Leaf is reliable, well built, easy to find, and any Nissan dealer can work on them. 
 
A Zoe is another option, but if buying an older model then make sure it has the extended warranty. Failures in the Zoe, although not 'common', can be very expensive to fix. In our 2014 Zoe's fifth year, the warranty covered repair bills exceeding £2k, with steering and suspension problems, and the air conditioning compressor failing completely (which as a knock-on prevented the car charging properly as it was unable to cool the motor/batteries).",2021,10,26

"Well what can I say about the trip 
 
The Kona made it a joy to drive this trip. Did exactly the same run 3 years ago in a diesel Fiat 500 L MPW and it was torture.. 
 
We didn’t plan any exact charge stopping points in advance or have any plan a b or c. Other than having newmotion and plugsurfing RFIDs in reserve 
 
No range anxiety. Probably easier as having a copilot who is aufait with plugshare and the other charging apps. As a driver I can just ask her to find me a charger in x miles etc. And leave it at that. Bit more awkward if you are on your own 
 
But really was a pleasure to drive the trip. Average came in at 4.8 miles / KWh. Over the trip. As I was driving faster than normal to keep a flow otherwise on euro motorways you play that horrible lurch game in and out from behind lorries with an Audi attached to your back bumper by chewing gum.

"Hello all 
I would appreciate some help in short listing some EVs.  
 
I am after something smaller than my current 2009 Audi A4, with good range and a nice interior. My criteria are: 
 
 
 We have tight access so it needs to be narrow. 
 I need as much safety kit as possible for motorways - I don’t do long motor way drives often but when I do, I could really use ACC, LKA etc.  
 Good infotainment with buttons, not just touch screens, and CarPlay, preferably wireless. 
 My wife wants something nippy with good acceleration - I suspect almost any EV will do that though. 
 V2L would be useful. 
 It would be a company car lease, so it needs to be new, not used. 3 year budget probably under £18k. I can wait for delivery. 
 My current short list is really quite short: 
 
 Kia Niro EV (3 or 4) 
 Renault Megane e-Tech (techno) 
 Both have decent range, ok infotainment, nice enough interior (I think!), and look affordable. Kia probably shades it, although charging is slow, but we will mostly be charging at home. 
 
Similar cars I have currently excluded include: 
 
 MG4  
 Too wide (not keen on looks either) 
 
 Citroen ec4  
 Range is too small for long weekends away beyond a charging network. Might be a bit slow? 
 
 VW ID 3 / Cupra Born 
 I think the haptic controls would drive me nuts! Considering waiting for the rumoured new version with updated interior and controls… 
 
 Tesla M3 
 No CarPlay, and I just don’t want a Tesla (much though the supercharger network is wonderful) 
 
 Skoda Enyaq / Audi q4 / Kia EV6 / Ioniq 5  
 Too big, probably too expensive, although they are probably better cars. 
 
 Am I missing any good options? And should I reconsider any which I have excluded? 
 
Many thanks in advance!",2023,1,4

 @People's Front of Judea  under accounting rules, you can set 100% of EV lease / purchase / maintenance costs against corporation tax (100% capital allowance), but only if they are new, not second hand.  
 
You can then also claim back 50% of the VAT on lease / purchase cost too (although that's a separate set of rules).

It will compete against more 'stylised' EVs like the 500, Mini (30K+) and Honda e (34-37K). And it is the 'claimed' size of an ID3, so looks about right on the pricing front. I know it is Chinese etc, but I am old enough to remember when people made similar comments about Japanese and Korean cars. Unlike German cars it will come with 5 year warrantee, so should be OK I expect.

I looked at the video's last year and re acquainted myself again today and personally love the look of the car and interior is fab. 
 
Also a big selling point for me is Lookers are in my home town so very likely to get down there asap to see if they have one in the showroom to look at and sit in. 
 
I test drove the MG4 this week and to me this Cat looks far more interesting at similar price and probably has better quality trim etc as I thought the MG4 SE I took out felt a bit meh inside not something that would give me a smile and pride to own. Plus MG QC leaves a bit to be desired from reading on the MG Owners forum last few days.

Whatever option you have, you can only have one power source plug, and one plug into the car, you can't have an intermediate plug anywhere on your setup.  
 
Be that a type 2- type 2. One end plugged into the charging unit which switches on/off the supply depending on what the car is telling it.  
 
Or a 3 pin plug into an outlet, with a charging unit in-between and a plug to go into the car.  
 
You can't daisy chain them as it won't work, they're designed to defeat that.",2022,2,25
"I mean, it can be done, but what you'll end up with is effectively a small home wallbox (something like the EO Mini or Rolec QUBEV) on the end of a flex. Which is probably as bulky as just carrying the granny cable anyway and would cost a few hundred quid.",2022,2,25
"What you're asking for is outside the remit of the car's manual! So freddym has not really addressed your qn imho. Don't fret about it - you'll generally get a lot of conflicting suggestions in here! 
 
Aragorn's got it right. You can have a 13A plugin EVSE box which has a Type 2 socket on it, allowing you to just have the one Type2->Type2 cable in your car, which would indeed be nice. But what you can't do is simply take an existing off-the-shelf granny EVSE and have it modified, for the simple reason the standard granny EVSE will already know the current capability of the charging cable connected to the car. But once you make it socketted, the granny EVSE  must  first check the current capacity of the cable you plugged in, before it offers power to the car. Which I bet they don't do at the moment as it will be built-in to the internal software. 
 
The cable capacities of the Type2->Type2 are rated at 13A, 20A, or 32A, and all wall-mounted socketted (untethered) EVSEs will check the resistor value on 2 of the pins to decide what particular cable they've got, so it won't overload it by allowing 32A down a 20A Type2 cable. So this is why you need someone to in effect built a custom small EVSE, not difficult tbh using Viridian components. The sum total of the parts would look something like the various bits in here (plus the socket, not visible), all bundled into a smaller box. This pic is a Podpoint that's been completely rebuilt ground-up, after it broke.",2022,2,25
"Surely the ""device"" he was asking for was exactly that, a backup device to allow him to use a 13A socket when otherwise stuck. Its not really at odds with the manual at all. Its simply that the size of such a device means no volumetric savings over just taking the standard granny lead.",2022,2,25
"Indeed, all the granny chargers I've seen use PCB-mounted relays inside, nothing like as robust as a wall-mounted EVSE  should  use imho (not all do tho' ...) and I've had to swap out one granny relay that was beginning to overheat. And the PCBs themselves are a potential problem, as heavy use of said granny EVSE can wear out the solder connections over time, causing a sudden & violent overheating even that can short circuit the board and send 240V down the low-voltage signal wire & damage the car. Happened to me, bill >£1000 to repair. 
 
So what the OP wants needs to be a robustly constructed EVSE, just like what Viridian make & sell, but with the current turned to 10A (trivial on their kit) and supplied form a 13A plug as opposed to being hard-wired to the CU. And packaged into a more compact box than usual, so add a standard temperature cutout for luck, as fitted to the earlier pic above, but not present in my Rolec.",2022,2,25
"It actually sounds a reasonable bit of kit. I drive around with a Type2->2 cable & a granny, both coiled up sitting in the wheel-well of the full-sized spare I have in my boot. I just might look at how big the box for all this would need to be, an aluminium one would also transfer internal heat to the outside far better than plastic-cased grannies do, a useful bonus that reduces thermal-cycling ageing.",2022,2,25
"When I read this I thought perhaps the OP han a BEV with a tiny boot, such as Fiat 500 or Mini. No, they have an Ioniq (PHEV sadly   ) which has a decent boot! 
 
I really can't see the issue of carrying both a Type 2 cable and the portable EVSE. Any other solution would not be cost effective especially with a small battery. Perhaps they may save £1 a time so it would take hundreds of uses to get their money back! In fact, some hotels actually charge £10 to use their socket which costs most than the (maybe) 40 miles they would cost in petrol!",2022,2,25
"Well, when OP upgrades to an Ioniq 38   he will find his boot space has decreased a bit   so space in there becomes even more valuable! And he could even consider fitting a Commando plug rather than a 13A one, allowing 16A charging! ",2022,2,25
"It is possible to build a pretty tiny portable EVSE, really only for occasional use, if someone really needs a very compact cable. I made such a cable for my wife's Zoe, because Renault wanted around £500 for one as an option. It's never been used, but fits in the limited space under the boot floor easily, taking up less room than a normal granny lead, plus it's about twice as long. I couldn't be bothered to make a circuit board up, so just bought one of these tiny EVSE modules:  EVSE Kit V3 For EV Charging Station/Cable (2X16A Relay) - Kit Only | shop.GWL.eu",2022,2,25
"Most of the time I leave the granny charger at home. As there's no point taking up a big load of boot space with a charge cable I'll hardly ever use. And yeah it does take up space, when we go on holiday two adults and two kids boot space is at a premium!

"The eNiro's HVAC is efficient, but it can't work miracles. You're turning everything on which will put a fair drain on the battery. On such short journeys no amount of efficient driving will offset that. 
 
Take a look at the consumption info screen (EV button > tap the percentage > tap the top row) and you'll see a significant percentage of your consumption is going on Climate and Electronics.

"Just to be clear, it's not that a short journey is inherently less efficient (battery heat might have a slight impact but it's not significant in this case) it's that the energy you're using to heat the cabin isn't ""spread out"" over more miles. 
 
Try wrapping up super warm one day and trying the journey with Climate off and no heated seat/wheel - you should see significant improvement in the miles/kWh. 
 
That's not to say you need to drive around freezing - by all means keep comfortable - but hopefully that experiment will highlight that it's your heating requirements that are impacting your consumption

"I’d say the figures you’re getting for short runs in low temps, using heating, are probably fine. If you have the time, take a longer drive and see what you get. 
 
The Niro (and presumably the current soul) has a battery heater that operates below 12 degrees (I think). I’ve noticed a big difference in power consumption figures between ambient temps of 8 and lower and around 11. The first few miles are much higher consumption. Some longish low speed runs at the weekend (country roads so sub 60mph) returned about 4mi/kWh overall with relatively little heating and careful driving. It took probably about 10 miles before the watt-o-meter showed better than 3mi/kWh. That was about 5-7 degrees outside 
 
yesterday it was much warmer, mix of A road and town driving for 35 miles, used heating throughout back up to 4.5mi/kWh.",2020,12,1
"It's cold and on short journeys your heating system is probably at full whack for most or all of the journey. I've had short trips (~2 miles) that got >6 mi/kWh and others that were <1.5 mi/kWh because of the different inclines, road conditions, and temperatures.",2020,12,1
"Remember that the loss is more noticeable in EVs because the total amount of energy available is much lower. If you lose 1kWh of petrol (100ml or so?) you don’t notice, but in an EV that’s 2-3% of the total stored energy.",2020,12,1

Struggling now to get above 3.5 even on a decent length local run (above 10 miles), with HVAC only occasionally on but with heated seat and steering wheel on to compensate. On short runs, like the 2 miles to my mothers, it can return around 2m/kwh, but the more you drive the more it returns to an acceptable level because of the spreading out of the heating losses. A long motorway run at the weekend returned 3.2m/kwh. I am resigned though to it not returning to an average closer to 4 until the weather improves next spring.",2020,12,1

No extra servicing as we do less than 18k per annum.

Tyres last say 20k miles and cost £200 = 1p per mile. 
 
So the only question is depreciation - hpivaluations seems to suggest £50 per 1000 miles at its current 2 years old / 18k, however I suspect if we keep it to 6 years old this will be less but currently 5p/mile.

"A simple comparison .. would be to check the lease cost of two equivalent car .. one ICE and one EV 
 
I did find out that VW lease a ""standard"" Gold, with a MSRP of around 21k USD for for 169USD a month (3k initial payment) .. while the -Golf is offer for 159USD per month and 2350USD initial payment (MSRP of the e-golf is 29K USD) 
 
Even if the e-Golf has an initial price 8k USD or ~35% more expensive ... the cost of owning the golf in the first 3 years with leasing .. it is cheaper the EV version vs ICE ... plus ... electricity is 2 to 4 times cheaper then the cost of petrol or diesel per km of usage

"I agree that personal situation has probably the biggest impact on the economy of an EV for people, but I'm really confused by some of the numbers being presented in this discussion - An Ioniq that does 5 miles per kwh, so a 9kwh PHEV does 45 miles, or the 30kwh EV does 150 miles, surely that isn't right is it - and then the tarifs being quoted for electric are almost unbelievable, is everyone on fixed deals that came in 10 years ago? although seriously on that point I'm really going to have to check my supply isn't ripping me off! And as for saying a 2 year old Leaf pisses all over my V60 SE Nav borders on madness - try hitting a truck in a leaf, EV or not !!!",2017,6,12

"I did the maths very recently for E7 vs standard tariff, and ignoring EV use, the difference between the best E7 tariff and the best non-e7 tariff was very small. 
 
 Power Consumption Chart  
 
Thats using real power measured at my DB over a fortnight (i've more data to add but havent done so yet, however it was a typical 2 week period), broken down into hourly segments to allow me to compare the various tariff options. 
 
As you can see, the best standard tariff currently available is 11.75p, and the best E7 tariff is 13.1/7.5p on and off peak. Those arent historic tariffs, they're the current best tariff available on uswitch for my consumption and area. 
 
If you compare ""household use"" which doesnt include any EV charging at all, you can see that the cost over that 2 week period is essentially the same, 25p more for E7. 
 
Its also worth noting that the E7 tariff would be better than shown as if we were actually on E7 we'd shift the washing machine and dishwasher to run overnight, thus moving two fairly large consumers to the cheap rate. At the moment the washing machine goes on overnight about half the time, and the dishwasher almost never.",2017,6,12

An electric cars tree hugging image is the single largest hurdle to overcome if we want mass adoption yet 95% of the people on here are still hugging trees.  
 
I bought mine 100% to save money. I personally can only get the maths to add up for local journeys now. Everything outside the range of my ev is done in my ice car now as it's cheaper.

"I couldn't give a fig if you buy it for the green credentials, the running costs or because it's a fashion item (I'm looking at you, Fiat 500!). One more EV on the road is one less ICE clogging up our lungs.",2017,6,13
"I have my PHEV because I needed a new (as in replacement, now new off the forecourt) car and EV looked the right way to go. Wanting an ""estate"" and my arbitrary budget limit was the amount I was paying into my smaller mortgage until just months before when it was paid off, I homed in on an Outlander on a 3 year lease - on the assumption that at the end of that period the tech would have moved forward enough to give me more choice. 
 
I then ended up taking a long postponed Solar PV install with the EVSE install, and finally 18 months later I got around to finishing the adaptive charging control for the EVSE that allows me to match the surplus PV to the car charging. 
 
My usage, coincidentally, allows me to drive one day and cycle another on my commute. Unless I know I will need the car in the morning I only plug it in when I leave the house so it charges during the day while I'm at work. Typical weekend profile is to go pick up mum for Sunday lunch/coffee and leave the car topping up while she's here. So far this has worked remarkably well but all by happy accident. Winters are more painful, but I have not yet had the adaptive charging for a full winter. 
 
If and when to move to the next car in a year, which is more likely to be full BEV, then I'm thinking the 32A available on the EVSE will come into it's own, but will still have the lower current levels for daytime charging. 
 
I didn't buy an EV because I want to ""save the planet"" (it's too late to save humans as we live now, and I don't frankly care) but because it seems overall the right thing to do.",2017,6,13

"By the time I'd bought my Zoe, I'd figured out that there was not really much financial saving over a cheap ICE if any. But that wasn't the point. I realised that it wouldn't 'save the planet' in the short term as much of the electricity comes from burning oil/coal, but it does help enable a transport system where we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, and which ultimately can be 100% renewable. With the rapid fall in the price of solar and wind, this will probably now happen in the next 15 years or so.

A number of things could happen: Chargers will log and report charging (my pod point does already) and public charger certainly can. Once there are more charging points cars likely won't have a 3 pin option. The car itself could easily report on KWH used charging it regardless of what you connect it to. As you say there are other ways they may charge outside of the energy but one thing is for sure we can't afford to use Fuel Duty from the government income when EV's do take off.,2017,6,13
"@Aragorn  But surely you would have owned the older car, whereas you're just renting one? and yes, if you do a fair few miles, there are cost savings, I don't dispute that - my original question was more to do with whether peoples expectations of what having personal transport actually costs us are being driven substantially higher by the EV revolution, and whether that can then be abused by electricity suppliers, or by governments trying to stop us having ""freedom"" in the far future.

How good of a business move this is remains to be seen. On one hand if they started with a cheap low spec'd car, the brand will forever be attached to that lower price point. On the other a higher spec'd car as an introduction might mean people will like it more but the price won't help. But given the massive EV shortages here, I'm sure the car will sell very well nonetheless.",2022,5,27

When I collected the car from the dealer on Sunday I’m fairly sure the gom was showing 175/179 miles. I expected to see likewise this afternoon after a full charge however the gom is showing a max of 150 in comfort mode. That steps down to 121 when I turn on the heater. 
 
Note I only drove the car for 5 minutes after the full charge back home. 
 
To explain, I’m currently waiting on a pod point install at home.

I now zero the trip computer every time I fully charge just to keep an eye on this - useful to have miles covered and SOC displayed permanently on the central display. I can see why it's often referred to as the GuessOMeter - GOM! 
 
So far the max I've got out of a charge is 136 miles, but I do quite a bit of motorway at 70 mph. 
 
Really enjoying the car though and no range anxiety so far.",2019,10,29
"Ignore the GOM range: it is at best an informed guess. What you are seeing is entirely normal. Over the past 5 years of i3 ownership I have actually seen the GOM range INCREASE/stand still as I have driven before starting to fall again. The system bases its future range prediction on your previous journeys. It follows if it was cold, wet etc on your previous journey, and you were driving with wipers and the heater on then your overall range showing on the GOM will have fallen.",2019,10,29
"^^^ how do you coast on an i3 where lifting off the accelerator engages regenerative braking? It’s a completely new way of driving. 
 
interestingly (or not) when i had an i3 on a 24 hour test you could easily see the regenerative miles being added to the gom. Not so much on my car.

"On very short journeys in cold weather the miles/kWh will be terrible because the battery heater is on and working to bring the battery temperature up.

Summer time is about 150 miles on the GOM when full. Sunday morning I came out to a cold car (air temp 3 C) at 100% after an over-night charge and the range was down to 130 miles. After a few miles of driving the range had gone down to 115 miles for elapsed plus remaining. After two 40 mile trips I came home the same day with 80 miles done and 55 miles of range left.  
 
Reset the trip every time the battery is at 100% and add the done miles plus remaining range and you will soon spot how the car alters the range mainly due to driving speed and style, road and weather conditions, and aux load.",2019,10,29

Wifey gets 4.1 miles per kw so range of 162 miles. Cold mornings I use about 4% more battery. Best thing to do is download  https://abetterrouteplanner.com  and play with the settings you can adjust temperature, rain, headwinds etc and see the sensitivity of range. In a ICE vehicle you don’t notice it as you have a big tank of fuel so a few mpg less you don’t notice in an electric there is more sensitivity. The good news is the i3 unlike some cheap EV’s has battery heating, aux heating etc so is a little less sensitive.",2019,10,29
"Perhaps we need a challenge. We all proudly boast about how many miles/kWh we can achieve: it would be interesting to see how few miles/kWh can be achieved. The bar has already been set. 
 
Seriously, driving in a conservative way in an i3 also has other benefits. The tyres, for example, have less starting tread than standard tyres and the rear ones wear both under acceleration and regenerative braking. The disc pads on an i3 are also much thinner than those on a standard car so conventional braking should be avoided wherever possible. I appreciate that the above does not sit well with the purchase of an i3S but this thread was about range.",2019,10,30

I was out and about yesterday when it was warmer than the previous few days. The GOM was showing 170 miles. I was 12 miles into the journey before the GOM range started to fall.

The pressures were spot on Tuesday through to Thursday but they rose by 0.1Bar on Friday with the warmer road surface.,2019,11,2

Next day after albeit a short economy plus drive the mileage was back to 154.

"REx is just a stop-gap until battery prices come down, and in short order we will be there. Car designs take years, so no point starting a REx one now.",2017,6,15
"From a economical point of view the Rex with large batt does not cut it. The cost of engine + large batts and then more maintenance and then lugging all that extra weight around. All that for a few journeys a yr that are further than BEV range which is rapidly becoming 200mls, and anti range anxiety. Its not the cars that need to get better as much as the drivers. I despair when i see drivers screaming up to red lights and then braking hard,not helped by cars that are too heavy and small engines providing little braking. This effect is only made worse in town EVs by adding all the extra weight. 
 
In my book the correct EV is one that does 90% of your journeys without even thinking about range anxiety. Does 5% where you need to drive with consideration/sympathy and 5% it cannot do without plan B.

"Yeah I really dislike the idea of a REx. I don't see the point having ICE tech in an electric car, which of course makes servicing etc a lot more expensive. 
 
In the next 5-10 years battery tech will be so much better, and ranges alot higher, that the need for a REx will be mute. 
 
It is a stop gap and that is all imo",2017,6,16
"Don't worry, REXes aren't an issue, it's the ""mild hybrids"" that are the coming thing. A little EV strapped to a conventional ICE, farting out a lightbulb's worth of power to scrape under the emission regulations.",2017,6,16
"What I find fascinating is that all car manufacturers are observing the same factors that are forcing them to look at the EV world more, and reaching totally different conclusions on how to react. Once they are launched on a chosen track it is hard to change course and they will soldier on rather than admit an error. 
 
Honda are a classic example of that. Hydrogen is clearly a mistake but they misread the political desire to back it as they understood that it could be taxed easier and that it would be a politically sound way to go. Unfortunately, they failed to also understand that politicians are clueless and will change tack as often as their underpants. Honda have a lot of ground to make up and risk losing credibility if they do make the necessary U turn. 
 
Others are only dipping a toe in the water as they are forced to do by the 'compliance' rules. They deliberately make a car that is useless but satisfies the rules and then make every effort not to sell it so that they can claim no demand. Nissan seems to be in a bit of a conflict too. They have a tiger by the tail with the Leaf. But rather than build on it by leapfrogging the competition that is already announced, and maintaining their lead, the indication is that the new car will not even match the others. Not content with that they have built a car propelled entirely by petrol but using an EV final drive. Meanwhile all their existing customers have been baffled as to why they didn't build a Qashquai EV to decimate the Outlander. 
 
The whole future of EVs is still in the melting pot and it would appear that every manufacturer is still unsure on which way to push. To go full BEV, Rex, or ENote style - that is the question.",2017,6,16
"Whoever gets an EV to the market in the Qashquai sized sector at a reasonable price (£30k max), with a decent boot (425L min) and a decent range (250) will have a waiting list longer than a very long thing, and I'd be on it. The Hyundai Kona looked promising but it's a Juke rival, so too small. Model Y is likely to be too pricey.",2017,6,16

"Tesla Model 3 design is “pretty much final,” plus new insights from a batch of high quality photos

 TESLA MODEL 3 
  
Another day, another batch of Model 3 photos, and more new insights about the car’s design. This time the photos come from multiple posts on reddit by You You Xue,  u/youyouxue , who spotted the Model 3 at the San Mateo supercharger and got several high quality photos which we’ll have a look at below. 
 
 Xue said he spoke to the employee who was driving the car, and that the employee stated that the car is pretty much the final design before the first delivery (*not a direct quote from the employee, but Xue’s summary of the conversation). One thing to note is that the cockpit and steering wheel looks the same as it did in  the other recent batch of photos  we saw of them, so if this is pretty much the final design, then it’s likely that we’ll end up with a rather conventional steering wheel design on the finalized vehicle. It’s still possible that it might change, but looking less likely as we get closer and closer to release. Today’s photo of the steering wheel and interior does look the same as those other recent photos, so if Tesla is still keeping any secrets, they must be keeping them rather close to their chest.",2017,6,22

"Volvo to launch Tesla-rivalling Polestar sub-brand 
 
Volvo's performance sub-brand is taking on Tesla and BMW's i with its own range of bespoke electric models 
 
 
WORDS BYDarren Moss 'What Car' 
 
 
 
 21 Jun 2017 11:02 Last updated: 21 Jun 2017 11:21 
 
 
Volvo’s performance sub-brand, Polestar, will produce its own range of sporty electric vehicles, with the first model likely to be revealed later this year at the Frankfurt motor show. 
 
Electric cars made by Polestar won’t carry a Volvo logo, much in the same way that Fiat’s performance arm, Abarth, doesn’t put a Fiat badge onto its cars. However, while Abarth tunes existing Fiat products – such as the  500 hatchback  and  124 Spider  convertible – Polestar will be producing its own, bespoke vehicles. 
 
Polestar’s cars will use the same underpinnings as Volvo models – bosses have previously hinted that the first Polestars could be based on the  S90 ,  V90 ,  XC90  and  XC60  – but they’ll look substantially different inside and out, feel different to drive, and are likely to carry bigger price tags. 
 
Indeed, Polestar officials have told What Car? that this is the company “raising its head for the first time” as a bespoke car maker. 
 
 
 
Polestar’s entry into the electric car market will put it into competition with established performance-oriented electric brands such as BMW i and  Tesla . 
 
The brand’s focus on producing high-performance electric vehicles means it’s unlikely to compete with mass-market options including the  Renault Zoe  and  Nissan Leaf , but will instead focus on rivals including the  BMW i8 ,  Tesla Model S  and  Model X .",2017,6,22

"GM’s Chevy Bolt EV sales increase to new high of 1,642 units 
 Fred Lambert

 CHEVY BOLT EV   GM 
  
 
Albeit slowly, GM’s Chevy Bolt EV sales are still growing – reaching a new high of 1,642 units in the US last month. 
 
It brings the total delivered of the new all-electric vehicle in the US to 7,592 units since the beginning of the year and just over 8,000 since its launch in December 2016. 
 
In June,  GM opened Chevy Bolt EV orders for approved dealerships nationwide,  But that didn’t contribute to deliveries since the first shipment to the new approved dealerships are expected in August. 
 
At that point, we should have a better idea of the market for the Bolt EV. 
 
In the meantime, it’s still not clear if the vehicle is still production constraint or if it’s a demand issue. In certain markets where the vehicle is officially available, it can be difficult to get your hands on one, while in other markets, like California, there are decent inventories and some  customers have been getting away with paying $25,000 after incentives  due to discounts. You can always check with  your local dealers for inventory  and see if you can find a deal. 
 
The Chevy Bolt EV has an MSRP of $37,500 before any incentive. 
 
A few vehicles have also been shipped to Canada and to Opel in Europe, but the bulk of its market is still the US, where sales have been growing slowly month to month over the last quarter:",2017,7,3

"VW unveils all-electric research car with 250 miles of range and mobile charging robots 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 5:10 am ET  
 
  
 
Volkswagen’s research group displayed some of the new and cutting edge technologies that it has been working on recently – including some related to electric vehicles. 
 
They unveiled their all-electric research car, which is capable of over 250 miles of range, a first for VW’s EVs, and new mobile charging robots are presented as a possible charging solution for the vehicle. 
 
 The Golf-based vehicle serves as a test bed for VW’s upcoming electric vehicle programs, like I.D. concepts: 
 
“This provides an insight into the next generation of automobiles for efficient long-distance mobility with a range of more than 400 kilometres. The lightweight architecture has been designed for maximum crash safety including the battery. The battery is based on advanced lithium-ion cells and the efficiency of the electric motor has been optimised.” 
 
Volkswagen is also using the platform to test technologies related to electric vehicles. 
 
The most interesting is undoubtedly a “mobile robot charger.” They released a few pictures of the system: 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Despite the fact that the actual act of plugging an electric vehicle is no more cumbersome, actually arguably less, than refueling a gas-powered car, there seems to be some sort of obsession to try to automate it. 
 
There have been several different concepts, but VW’s mobile robot charger is certainly novel. The company sees some advantages for underground garages and multi-story car parks: 
 
“In future, rapid charging of the electric vehicle will be extremely convenient. Mobile robots will connect up the automobile for recharging. Group Research is therefore working on charging robot concepts for underground garages and multi-story car parks. The Gen.E research vehicle is charged by the robot.”",2017,7,4

"Electric cars reach record 42% of Norway’s total new car sales with boost from Tesla Model X 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 7:34 am ET  
 
 
 TESLA MODEL X   NORWAY 
  
While most countries have difficulties making electric cars reach 2% or 3% of their total car sales, Norway keeps pushing the bar higher and higher. 
 
Last month was another record month for the country with electric cars representing 42% of its new vehicles being registered.  
 
 That’s a significant jump from their last record in January when they reached 37% of new car sales . 
 
The country’s EV incentives, like the 25% VAT tax exemption, are helping maintain the rate of adoption about 10 times higher than most markets. 
 
In June, all-electric vehicles also reached a record 27% of new car sales with plug-in hybrids making up the difference. 
 
The record was helped by a big boost in Tesla Model X deliveries which had a record month in Norway with 609 registrations in June – enough to make it the second most popular vehicle in the country. The Model X contributed only 238 units to the last record. 
 
It was only surpassed by 874 VW e-Golfs, which remains very popular in Norway, like its gas-powered version, according to  new vehicle registrations  (Norwegian). 
 
Renault’s Zoe, which has been  dominating electric vehicle sales in several European markets , also had a good month contributing 428 vehicles to the new record. 
 
Finally, the first shipment of the Opel Ampera E, the European version of the Chevy Bolt EV, helped by adding 389 all-electric vehicles to the total, which may have resulted in an artificial increase of EVs for the month and created the record since G M is not expected to dedicate more of its Bolt production to Opel until next year.  
 
Nonetheless, Norway is really close to the tipping point of electric cars where they become the majority of car sales in the country, which has the goal to reach 100% of new car sales being zero-emission vehicles starting in 2025. 
 
With several new models coming to market in Norway next year, like Tesla Model 3, Audi e-tron quattro, and hopefully, the Opel Ampera E in higher volume, this new record of 42% of car sales could quickly seem low and the 2025 goal, which is among the most aggressive of any country, is starting to look attainable.",2017,7,4
VW had better make that a 5 door though or many won't buy it purely on those grounds. Have you ever tried getting out of a car with such huge doors in narrow parking spaces. Unless they plan a gull/swan/albatross door that is. In which case even more wouldn't buy it.,2017,7,4
"Tesla obtains design patents on Model 3 wheels 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 2:17 pm ET  
 
 
  
 
When first unveiling the Tesla Model 3 in March 2016, the prototypes came equipped with new wheels designed by the automaker. 
 
CEO Elon Musk said that  they “spent a lot of time on those” and that they plan on bringing them to production . Though a lot of things have changed since and Tesla plans to limit the options available on the Model 3 – at least at the beginning. 
 
 
 
Musk confirmed last month that  wheel size is probably one of the only options that early Model 3 buyers will be able to choose – that and the color. 
 
But he didn’t say anything about the options for the designs of the wheels, which is not always the same thing as wheel size. 
 
Now we learn Tesla has obtained design patents on 3 of the Model 3 wheel designs that were previously unveiled. While it doesn’t mean they will release those wheels, it means they are securing the rights to them. 
 
Tesla applied for the patents on March 30, as they were about to unveil the Model 3, and the design patents were released over the last month. 
 
Franz Von Holzhausen, Tesla’s Chief Designer, is credited for the design of each wheel, but longtime Tesla designer David Imai and Bernard Lee are also credited for the first Model 3 wheel design – United States Patent USD789860: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
That’s the wheel designed that has been the most commonly spotted on Model 3 release candidates in the wild. 
 
The second wheel design is an aero wheel option to improve the vehicle’s aerodynamic performance – United States Patent USD788672 : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Von Holzhausen and Lee are the designers credited for the design of this wheel. 
 
While not as popular as the first wheel, it was also  spotted on several Model 3 release candidates . 
 
As for the last wheel for which Tesla obtained a design patent last month, it was unveiled at the March 2016 event, but it was never spotted on any release candidate since – United States Patent USD788671: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
It was actually only seen on plastic model of the Model 3 and not on a working prototype like the two other vehicles. 
 
Joonas Vartola, a car designer who doesn’t work for Tesla anymore, is credited for the design of this one. 
 
If the release candidates are a good indicator of the options available for the Model 3, it looks this last one is not going to be available. 
 
We should have a better idea of the wheel options for the Model 3 once Tesla starts opening the online design studio, which is expected to happen on or around the 28th when Tesla will deliver the first few vehicles.",2017,7,4
"Fig 1 - OK

"Daimler announces new $740 million battery factory in China for Mercedes-Benz’s EVs 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 5th 2017 9:35 am ET  
 
 
  
 
Just a few weeks after unveiling  its own new battery Gigafactory for electric vehicles  in Germany, Daimler is now announcing a new $740 million battery factory project in China. 
 
The new factory will support the production of batteries for electric vehicles under the Mercedes-Benz brand. 
 
 It’s the first major project as part of Daimler’s new  investments in electric vehicles through its joint-venture with BAIC in China.  
 
Markus Schäfer, Member of the Divisional Board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Production and Supply Chain, commented on the announcement: 
 
“Building another premium eBattery factory is the next step in the implementation of our electric strategy. Thus, we have the first foreign location in our global battery production network. The local production of batteries is crucial in order to meet the demand for electric vehicles flexibly and efficiently,” 
 
While Daimler is making significant investments in battery production, they are still not producing battery cells. Like the one in Germany, the new factory will produce battery modules and packs, but they will be sourcing the cells from elsewhere. 
 
The German automaker wouldn’t confirm from which supplier, but they did say that the cells will be sourced from China. 
 
Berenberg Bank analyst  Alexander Haissl recently expressed doubts about the sourcing strategy of traditional automakers : 
 
“Clear visibility about high-volume cell-sourcing strategies continue to elude traditional manufacturers, although we expect announcements for large facilities to eventually emerge to resolve the key issue of battery supply constraints,” 
 
Daimler will be able to choose from several different battery cell manufacturers to supply its new factory. Several companies, like  Panasonic  and CATL , have been building battery cells factories in China. 
 
Hubertus Troska, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Greater China, also commented on the announcement: 
 
“We are investing in the world’s largest market for Battery Electric Vehicles, By 2025, the Chinese market will have a substantial share in sales of Mercedes-Benz electric vehicles. Therefore, local production will be key to the success of our EV portfolio, and crucial to flexibly serving local demand for electric vehicles.” 
 
They expect production at the new facility to start in 2020. 
 
The news comes just as  Tesla confirmed working with the Shanghai Government to establish its own manufacturing facility in the region.  
 
A clear rush to invest in electric vehicles is happening in China. Tesla wants to tap into what is now the world’s biggest auto market and legacy automakers are speeding up their plans to match the country’s ZEV mandate. Automakers need zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to represent 8% of new car sales as soon as 2018 and quickly ramp up to 12% by 2020.",2017,7,5

When I chose what I have it could have easily been a Leaf, while reading about them and their performance I was very impressed and can see why they are the top selling EV, are they still? 
I have sat in a Leaf, and it was nice feel, roomy, well laid out for most part and seemed to have everything you would want visible in the right place and I thought the drive selector was cute. The body shape for me looks better in certain colours but thats the same with everything, including kettles and toasters. 
 
Anyway the reason I chose what I have is a personal one that would probably not have been important to many, and with the specification from what I could see being about the same on all in my short list, the egolf came out on top not because it was a golf, not because it was VW, but because I love the  pure white  paint finish and, the icing for me...... 
 
.....they fit  Dynaudio , and That manufacturer has been seducing me with their sound for a long long time. 
But the car also  felt just right  from the moment I sat in one and went for a drive, biggest mistake ever going to see one as I made my mind up on the spot. 
Mines been called cold, bland, but just as Emily loved her saggy cloth cat. Baggy, and a bit loose at the seams. I love my egolf

"Hydrogen is very inefficient to produce. The losses in hydrolysis, compression and transport all but rule it out. On the motoring side the fuel cell is efficient but cannot produce power for acceleration so you still need batteries to cope with that. It then becomes complicated like a hybrid fossil fuel car, pretty pointless. There will be some uses in heavy transport, particularly railways where you have the space for the fuel tanks at lower pressures (but still at 300 psi or thereabouts) and batteries at the 100+ kW scale to provide for dragging freight up long hills. UK freight trains are running longer trains at night time now. There is a saving in fuel where a train is going up and down hills where the bit going down hill pushes or pulls the bit going up hill. This is the premise in the US and Canada where trains are run at up to 5 km long. Engines placed throughout the train radio controlled from the front. There are occasions when those trains are just going uphill, see Rogers Pass where CP run trains with up to 8 engines. The limit on the length of trains is often the brake lines which in winter ice up and the length of trains is often reduced to just 80 cars of 100 tons.",2022,4,3

"Hydrogen cars are, in a short phrase, a pretty fantasy. They appeal to the fossil lobby simply because they would maintain control over the distribution and supply of the thing that goes in the tank. They can transition to it away from petroleum as time passes, charging an arm and a leg for the transport and supply. It appeals to us punters because it requires the least change - it's the only 'reduced emission' way of powering a vehicle that involves stopping for a few minutes and topping it up. 
 
However. 
 
It is insanely expensive and energy inefficient to obtain, to the detriment of electrical generation supplies everywhere. The pressurised tank is expensive and complex, the pumping mechanisms are insanely expensive and awkward (see James May's video about his second Mirai noting that a relatively cold day can see it freeze to the car!), the cars are expensive, the actual cost of buying the Hydrogen is expensive and doesn't actually get you over far. 
 
For my two pennies, EDIT: I believe that a realistic future is thus: the decision that we must stop burning fossil fuels to try and save the planet has been made. Whether or not you believe in the climate change scenario is irrelevant; the path is already set. As part of that we who have been used to pumping a car full of liquid every 400 miles simply wont be able to anymore - and we'll be told tough. Jobs that  require  this may have some form of special diesel support perhaps but only if you can justify a genuine requirement for it. If you're a salesman swanning 600 mile round trip to have donuts with you're client, soz. You'll have to get a train instead or deal with the charging. CHargers will become more and more ubiquitous. Workplace charging, supermarket charging, rapid charging, communal charging. We'll have to compromise.

Plus the extra fuel costs as you need x3 as much energy to cover the same mileage in hydrogen vs full electric.

Refuelling in 5 minutes with hydrogen sounds great until you realise your nearest H2 fuelling station is a 90 minute round trip away. 
 
The Anti-EV lobby like to talk rubbish about battery replacement, but they never seem to talk about the fact that FCEV cars appear to have a 15 year lifespan - that is to say the hydrogen tank needs to be replaced after 15 years from manufacturing date due to the risks of embrittlement from Hydrogen.

 ""VW obviously wants its e-Up to be a massive sales hit. It won't be.  ""

See the transport ministers speech this week in another thread (""By 2050, we expect effectively every car on the road will be ultra low emission"") and EU, UK, US, Chinese, Indian etc legislation will drive change. 
The Fiat 500 EV version has massive sales potential but Fiat's CE was quoted recently that he didn't want increased sales of their US compliance model because they were made at a loss. The production costs of changing from ICE versions to EV probably reduces short term profitability for most manufacturers so they are dragging their feet until they face real completion or legislation. There has to be a reason why all the mass manufacturers are plodding along with same 100 mile range that won't sell well.

As stated before, unless you're doing without a car or seriously downsizing, any profit on the outgoing car will be swallowed up by the new one. There's definitely a ceiling on the price people will currently pay - generally around 15% more than RRP, and the person selling at retail needs to make money on the deal too. If you order a new car, and pay full RRP with no incentives, you'll only get what you paid for it selling to a car dealer through Motorway or similar. 
 
However, people seem to be willing to pay that 115% of RRP on a year old one, so as long as the current supply/demand mix continues, you could potentially keep a car for a year, order a new one as soon as you get the current one and sell the old one when the new one comes, for little to no depreciation. I just got rid of our 2 ID3s, swapped out for Borns - big profit on the ID3s bought at big discount was swallowed up by the fact I had to pay full RRP on the Borns - first time i've never successfully negotiated a healthy 15% on a new VAG. 
 
The only consumers making a big profit on a recently bought car at the moment are those that ordered/bought it with big discounts/incentives that are long gone now. 
 
I do think change is around the corner - this supply/demand bubble is about to burst IMO, not necessarily because supply is easing, more that demand is going to drop right off when these crazy oil and gas prices really start to cut into people's disposable income this Winter. I do think then that the incentives and discounts will be back, and when they are, the selling price of what you've currently got will take a tumble - no-one's going to buy your 1 year old £36k RRP car for £42k when a new £36k car is being sold for £32k and without much of a wait. 
 
We came out of lockdown with people itching to spend money and not really caring how much prices have gone up by, and that splurge time is coming to and end IMO.

I black Model S in Hereford city center on friday, I kinda geeked out and excitedly pointed at it, however the driver spotted my bike and was pointing at it excitedly as well. (I was chuffed) 
 
Then I spotted a nice Red Tesla near Warwick on sunday, I again excitedly waved to the driver, however I think he thought I wanted to race him, and waved a polite ""No"", not 'quite' my intention... ah well.

"Back in Chongqing for the last two days of our holiday. 
Been to Chendou and Haikou. 
Saw a Tesla in Chendou from the bus we were on. 
But the thing that has delighted me the most is going back to Haikou where I started my EV adventure (Christmas 2010), total domination of battery powered two wheel vehicles now. 
Not 60/40, nor 80/20. No, for all the hundrens of scooters that are passing you every few minutes you will maybe catch sight of one petrol bike. And perhaps sadly, so few ordinary cycles. But then it is so, so hot. 
My wife who is completely unimpressed by the whole ev thing, informed me towards the end of our Haikou leg that some of the taxis are electric. ""How did she know?"" I asked. ""Because they say so"" (stupid). As if I can read Chinese. 
Anyway the taxi-driver taking us to the airport claims Haikou has 200 ev taxis",2015,8,10

"My wife and I took friends to Heathrow yesterday and on the way they asked about my lovely blue Leaf. We had already explained we would stop at South Mimms to charge. 
Spotted a dark red Tesla on the way and they wanted to know what was so special about it. 
More for my wife’s sake, I replied that we could do the trip, Maldon to Heathrow; and back, all on the one charge.  
No need to stop to charge even once. 
My wife changed the subject. 
Anyway first charge stop, all bays empty, plug-in rapid and pop inside and thinking never met anyone charging here yet over the years. Come out and there’s a chap, nozzle in hand but not having any luck plugging in. We chat, he has another go with the new plug (prompted by me as I hadn’t seen this new style one) and it located ok. 
Anyway in the process told him about the forum pointing to the sticker. He is a My Electric Avenue owner and very likely to have another Leaf at the end of the lease. 
We go off to Heathrow, drop our friends and come back for the second charge. 
Black Leaf there this time in my place so I got to use the new plug myself. Easier and better looking. Seemed faster but then I wasn’t chatting as missed seeing the other Leaf owner. 
Probably warned off by my wife.

"Have car makers lost interest in the market for ultra-compact cars? 
 
I've recently put down a deposit on a Smart ForTwo EQ and... TBH I'm not too impressed with it, overall. OK - it's a decent enough drive, but it's now quite an old design (last facelift was 2017?) which means that the battery management options are primitive by today's standards - so for example it has no built-in facility to control the level at which charging stops. And for a tiny car with fairly basic features it isn't cheap. 
 
But where are the alternatives? The Twizy lives on (I think) but Renault persists with their crazy battery lease model, and it's not a car anyway. Nor is the Citroen Ami One. Germany's e-GO seems to be back from the brink, but they have no plans for a RHD version. 
 
The thing is that (to me at least) a 2-seater makes a lot of sense for ordinary shopping use, when you don't need a big range and you don't need to be lugging around a 4-door body and corresponding big battery. But every manufacturer seems to rushing to bring out as many electric SUVs and crossovers as they can - as if bigger must always be better! 
 
Does the Smart One signal the end for the FourTwo and FourFour? What (if anything) is on the horizon that could be thought of as a real replacement for the original Smart concept?",2022,4,26
Following this thread with interest seeing as I'm part of a two person household with 20 miles per day travel requirements at most. Also in the 'not a car' category is the Carver Electric which I recently got to sit in. Base model is 28mph but they do a 48mph model. Seats 2 if the second person is under 6 feet tall. Given how cheap some 4 door EVs are (corsa e was 22.3k recently) I think a two seater will struggle to meet the safety requirements of a car while being cheap enough to be considered.,2022,4,26

"Thanks - the Carver Electric product looks great fun - but it's not going to solve the problem of people with ""proper cars"" (i.e. big cars) treating things like that with contempt. I.e. tailgating them and overtaking in stupid places. 
 
One of the things I like about the current generation of Smart cars is that they have made them just big enough to be considered as ""proper cars"" by your typical Audi/BMW/MB driver - so you should not get too much intimidation on the road. Much as I admire the brave decisions behind the Ami, I can't escape the suspicion that its top speed is going to lead to all sorts of silliness from the average ICE car commuter waiting patiently (not) behind you... 
 
Perhaps I will have to consider something like the Corsa or the Fiat 500 - though I guess I would be dragging around a fair bit of extra weight with either of those than a FourTwo. 
 
And I agree that the charging thing is not a big issue - but I can't help feeling that Daimler/MB are not really committed to the Smart in terms of support and development, and that they are actually quite keen to pass it on to Geely (i.e. get rid of it) in the mid-long term. Certainly the MB dealership that I visited did not seem too interested in selling me one, and a month on they have still not been able to even suggest a rough estimate for the delivery date... though I concede that a large part of this is due to supply chain issues and not specifically a lack of interest in the car itself.",2022,4,26

"I did a few trips up to Northumberland in the summer using only Instavolt and 230 miles seemed quite achievable on the M1/A1M (although usually I would charge at around 130-140 miles into the journey). 
But that 84 kWh battery takes quite some charging on the more common 50 kW chargers. 
I suspect that the New Fiat 500 might actually be quicker on a long journey because it can 20-80% charge in under 30 minutes (even though the range per charge is less).",2021,1,11

"Well its here our Glacier Blue Outlander PHEV, been driving it for a few hours now. A lot of about town stuff and then motorway drive home for 75 mins. First impressions: - 
- Better than I thought it would compared to the test drive, now having had a chance to push it around some roundabouts and corners handles better than I thought it would do. 
- Lots to learn with dashboard info, sat nav OKish, to start off a little distracting but something you would get used to. 
- The screen showing the Energy Flow is quite useful, the manual could be made more user friendly, a quick user guide would not go amiss. 
 
and then the all important electric / ice. 
- Once started, or powered up might be more appropriate, simple as foot on brake put into drive and off you go. 
- We had about 22 miles of EV range and used this up to and froing in busy Friday PM town traffic with air con on, nice and quiet. 4 people in the car and all had plenty of space. 
- As we set back home we had only a few miles left of EV range and it quickly went as we went onto the fast A roads but ICE kicked in and seamless. 
- For a while doing 70 just on electric, we only knew that from the energy flow screen 
- Left it top run on ICE for a while and then halfway home hit the charge button. In 15 or mins had 8 mile range but I was doing 70mph on the motorway at the same time. I was impressed how quickly it charged and drove the car. 
- Flappy paddles for regenerative braking, used these loads for braking the car coming up to traffic lights, using full force to start with and then lessen the force as we neared the traffic lights, its like going through the gears a bit but in reverse! 
- MPG figure when we started off in the afternoon with 9 miles on the clock with 99mpg but when we got home it was 38mpg. I put this down to using the engine to charge the battery, I hope. 
- Radio / sound system decent enough, radio seemed a bit more confusing that it needed to be, time will tell, probably me 
- Driving up to our house got a strange look from lady at the bottom of the road seeing this silent car travel up the road. 
 
And to note 
- Only 13 amp cable for charging, when we went for test drive saw it had 2 cables, one for public charging and 13amp, mine only supplied with 13amp, assume other cable is optional extra 
- No puncture kit, queried it bit forgot to followup at dealership 
- Towing, manual is huge and stumbled across a strange comment about steep hills that the battery should be charged 20 mins before attempting the ascent. Given I am going across the alps in the summer with a caravan in the summer it could be a long drive, only slightly nervous.  
 
First impressions 
- Better than I thought, no real negatives yet 
- Now plugged in for the night charging, night night phev

"Kevin, 
Thanks for the review. I had the British Gas man here on Thursday (given the OLEV commentary was pleased he showed) and put in the charging unit (16A) for free. I then had a call from the garage to say it has arrived so went up there yesterday to fill out some paperwork primarily relating to the £5k grant. They had a couple of demonstrators there and claimed to have sold another 18 since last Thursday. My GX4 (pearl) is due next Friday - with detachable towbar. 
I am lucky to be able to park outside my house by the charging unit and do not intend bothering with public fast charging as my vehicle will be primarily school run and central London/congestion zone. However I am curious as to the length of the supplied charging cable. Kevin - any idea how long it is?

"Hi  @Maddog . 
 
Sorry for the delay... I have only just seen this question: 
 
A cable suitable for Mode 3 charging of the Outlander or any Type 1 (J1772) car, is our Type 1 to Type 2 cable  here : 
 
Mode 3 charging: Fixed and dedicated socket-outlet 
Mode 3 can be used for the charging of an electric vehicle and this is the preferred solution in the long term. Mode 3 chargers are defined in 2 configurations, either with a tethered cable or a dedicated socket-outlet. 
 
The outlander only comes with the 5 meter 10amp EVSE from the dealer. The equivalent cable to above (however 16amp) is around £300. 
 
Be cautious with 16amp cables as some public charge points don't accept them. 
 
I hope that helps... 
 
Mark",2014,6,23
"I pick mine up tomorrow evening, it was on the June 5th ship.  @Mark  Do I need a to get a cable? I was assuming the fast charge points had their own cables that you just plug in to the fast charge socket on the car. Also is there a definitive one stop map of the charge points anywhere? Each company seems to have its own map. As you can tell im new to EVs.",2014,6,24
"Ah thanks that explains it, I think we should be fine then, I am expecting to only use the rapid charges on long trips , most other journeys should be covered by the EV range and charging at home. I have a Ecotricity card , and a charge master from my BG polar install, have not subscribed to them yet though.",2014,6,24
"I got my BG charger installed a few months ago and was lucky as BG did it them selves. They could only fit a 13amp charger, for the fast charger you need thicker cables, so It has to be installed very near your consumer unit. I have a small secondary consumer unit in my shed which they wired it into. My dad tried to get one installed in his garage by a sub contractor from British Gas who said he needed a consumer unit added to the garage and wanted to charge him £250 for the pleasure, so I am just using the 13A plug there. He was also upset at having to drive round peoples houses and not being able to install the chargers and not getting paid for it. I would call BG and try to get a BG person to do it if possible rather than a sub contractor. 
 
I am also interested in the difference between charging through a 13A plug and a 13A polar charger. I am assuming the charger has some way of varying the current to help the battery charge better/quicker. I am not convinced of the need/benefit of a 13A charger, but I am sure I will be enlightened!",2014,6,24

But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable.

"I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.",2022,2,4
"As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available. 
 
There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year. 
 
OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.",2022,2,4

So financially I view the MG4 as a better bet at the current launch prices.

"I've had it a month. Perfectly happy with the Zoe as a car, although it doesn't set my world on fire. The petrol Corsa and Fiat 500 I had as hire cars over summer were more fun to drive, better cabins and CarPlay worked flawlessly. 
 
I'm glad I haven't signed a 36 month lease, and I'm keeping my eye open for alternatives. If I didn't need the range, I would almost certainly have gone with the i3. 
 
Likes: Range is good ~190 motorway miles, mine has been flawless on CCS, decent size boot, auto hold works well, feels nippy, cruise control has a nice easy off button that you can use to scrub off speed, 22kW AC (theoretically) v useful for me.

"I just joined this forum, mainly to have a good moan at anyEV manufacturers who might be watching. 
 
- I have been wanting to buy an EV for over 25 years but the prices are just way too extortionate and the designs WAY too unimaginative. If you want to sell lots and get people into something new, then make it cheap. 
 
- All that's on offer are city cars. They are inadequate to me and countryside dwellers. 
 
- The few cars that look like they might be able to go down a farm track are overpriced 4WDs designed for city snowflakes who might dare to venture out of town once in a blue moon. 
 
- I do not need electronic tat and nor do my passengers. They should be grateful they are getting a lift at all. 
For example, instead of a stupid radio I just want a storage compartment. I am not a phone drone and do not want to be telephoned while I am driving, so don't sell me junk I don't need. 
 
- FFS you can't get simpler propulsion than a battery, speed controller and electric motors! So make the thing so I can fix it myself when it goes wrong. Stop presuming *everyone* is too stupid to repair something. And FFS make the spares cheap! It means people will be more likely to buy your cars!  
 
- I don't ever need to go much faster than the speed limit and I do not need to do wheelies. Nor do most female or older drivers. 
 
- I do not need to do more than XX miles/kms in a day. So have spare battery compartements that can be used for storage and that take the extra batteries for long range trips. It's a waste of energy carting unused batteries around. 
 
- In fact, make everything modular so it's versatile. WTF is there no modularity in vehicle designs? It would be another MASSIVE selling point!  
 
- I need a decent wheelbase height. Many tracks have ruts that would ground snowflake vehicles. 
 
- I presently own an old Suzuki Jimny and an old Daihatsu Terios. Something with similar capabilites but much lighter and much more efficient would be acceptable. 
 
- Make EVs designed for countryside use. 
 
- Ask people what they want. It's the communications age. Are your company and design department incapable of listening to customers? You only need one page on your car company website to list new ideas and you sure don't have many of your own. 
 
Is there anybody else out there in my shoes?",2019,1,10
"You don't need to prove anything to me, Jeremy. 
Meanwhile there is STILL no average price EV for normal countryside use by countless millions of people living outside of towns across Europe and the world. There isn't even a proper term for such a thing! ""Sports utilty vehicle"" only applies to townies going on Picnics, surfing or mountain biking once a month.",2021,5,20
"Actually, you wrote all sorts of other OT stuff but haven't actually contributed anything useful apart from saying that an 81k GBP Jaguar has 4wd and variable ground clearance. 
The farmer's wife (or anyone living out of town), meanwhile, still has no sensible EV choice to get her down a potentially muddy or snowy track every day for school runs or essential shopping. Nor does anyone else who wants to swap to electric from a small 4wd or a pitted-track-capable 2wd with knobbly tyres and a big boot.  
Something as inane as roof bars for carrying long stuff aren't even incorporated into everyday cars as standard. The mind boggles at the lack of imagination of modern-day car designers and planners.  
They are comparable in dumbness to modern Architects who essentially cover the place in dreary rectangles and regular shapes and are utterly clueless that ""picturesque"" requires irregular and rounded shapes.",2021,5,20
"Manufacturers aim to build what people want to buy, at a price they can afford. The problem is not one of design, it is one of economics. It costs very large sums of money to set up a car production line - anyone that doesn't believe that just needs to look at how much VW poured into the ID.3/ID.4 production facilities, or how much money Elon Musk and his investors have poured into Tesla's Gigafactories. 
 
There has been over 100 years of gradual improvement in production engineering of conventional cars, making them cheaper to produce, safer, more reliable etc. To a large extent making EVs goes right back to square one. There is not a massive assortment of tier one and two suppliers ready and able to supply EV parts to manufacturers at a low price. There are not large number of car designers around with experience in EV design, covering everything from proven crash and fire safety engineering techniques through to MMI design. manufacturers around the world are having to go back to basics, and some of them are still getting it very seriously wrong.   
 
VW, for example, spent billions in developing the MEB platform and producing the ID.3, yet have hit some really major production problems, despite the fact that the ID.3 is a pretty simple and straightforward car, and one that is similar in outward appearance to other conventional cars that the VAG have been making for years. Similarly, Tesla have run into similar problems with the early production of the Model 3, delaying the launch of the car and then going on to delay its release to overseas markets. Neither of these cars are particularly cheap, but neither are they very profitable for their manufacturers. It will take years for VW to recoup the money they have invested in getting the ID.3 to market, and that is selling in a very popular segment. 
 
What hope is there that any manufacturer could design and sell a relatively small volume market EV such as it seems you want? Someone mentioned the 2CV earlier in this thread. It is worth remembering that the 2CV lost money for Citroen for decades. It cost more to manufacture than they could sell it for, much as happened with the first Mini, that was another car that only survived because the company got propped up with government money. 
 
If someone can come up with a way of reducing the design and development cost for a new car design, and can come up with a way of reducing the manufacturing cost of the car and all its component parts, and last of all come up with a way of reducing the marketing, sales and dealer support costs, then maybe the car you want might get manufactured. I think this is some time off, though, as right now some of the key parts for EVs are just too expensive, when compared to the equivalent parts for conventional cars. In particular, batteries, power electronics and safety critical software are all expensive, some because of the availability of materials, some because it's just very labour intensive, and uses highly paid people.  
 
That will change as products and sub-assemblies mature and the initial design, development, testing and certification cost for these new component parts gets amortised over larger number of manufactured parts, just as happened with the Ford Model T, which also started out as an expensive car, but over the course of a few years became affordable for the masses as Ford reduced the cost of production.",2021,5,20
"What ""I want"" is not a ""small volume, niche vehicle. It's what virtually every family living in semi-rural areas needs. A car built for everyday countryside use, just as city cars are for an everyday city environment. Even in the overpopulated UK there are millions living in rural areas and travelling through rural areas every day. 11 MILLION, to be precise!!!:  U.K. Rural Population 1960-2021  That is about 16% of the GB population. 
 
That means it must be able to reliably go down a moderately rutted track in bad weather (snow/mud) and cope with a snow/mud covered country lane after a heavy downpour. It should be able to cope with wet grass. After storms, it should be able to pull a heavy branch off the lane with rope. It should have roof bars for carrying long things. The boot should be easily cleanable, it may carry logs or dogs or other unclean stuff. It should not be big and heavy. It should be repairable by the owner. Should have a tow hitch for small trailers. Min 8"" Ground clearance and a (slow) 4wd option. High seats for visibility. steep approach angles, bigger diameter wheels. 
 
Most Townie EVs wouldn't need much redesign to fit many of those specs, hell they could do a rural version for most Townie cars if the designers had even half an imagination!  
Rural people aren't that interested in ""styling"" and electronic $hlt, they want a reliable, functional vehicle that's easy to fix, and doesn't get stuck or damaged easily. They don't need to go faster than 75-80mph, ever. 
The market size for such a car is at least 16% of the UK population, probably much more, because even Townies would want a proper countryside-capable vehicle instead of the posey soccer-mum SUV so many townies now own for some reason.",2021,5,20
"Is your requirement REALLY a mass market one? 
 
A good test would be to look at how many conventional cars there are on the market right now that fulfil those needs. The spec sounds very close to that for the old Daihatsu FourTrak I owned as a cheap tow car for several years. That was a bit basic, but did all the sort of stuff that you seem to be looking for with ease and it was pretty cheap to both buy and run. It was one of the most reliable cars I've owned, but in fairness I didn't do a lot of miles in it each year. 
 
The snag is that cars like this never sold in large volumes. I live in a very rural area, surrounded by woods and farmland, and yet cars like this just aren't massively popular. There are quite a lot of 4x4 pickups around, all Japanese, as they seem to have taken over from old Landrovers as the vehicle of choice for farmers and farm workers around here. Even then I don't think there are large numbers of them.",2021,5,20
"Well yes, the ICE version is called an ""SUV"" and designed mainly for Townies, not people who actually live in rural areas. SUVs are massively popular. 
I have a Daihatsu Terios and a Suzuki Jimny, The Suzuki Ignis had high ground clearance. Subaru made 4wd farmer's cars. Tthe Fiat Panda 4wd is another one and a few more. But you are wrong about there having to be a popular ICE version. Wouldn't you want a car designed to be largely repairable by.... YOU?! Even inluded detachable roofrack bars would be a selling point, as would be a slightly raised version of most cars with bigger wheels and ground clearance. Not exactly rocket science.",2021,5,20

"Howdy, I had a couple of questions and was wondering if someone could help. I'm no electrical engineer, but I have an AC motor (96v - 650a max) that I know I can run off a battery bank through an inverter. Now, I would also like to run this motor at times off of a PTO generator using an automatic transfer switch to switch back and forth between the battery bank and the PTO depending on which one is generating enough power to run the motor. I know the batteries would end up needed to be charged and that we are considering solar, wind, etc. The PTO would be driven by a tractor based on the required input to the PTO generator specs. Now my question is, is this even possible the way I have it drawn? I have the specs for the ATS, motor, and PTO. The PTO and ATS are based on the idea of a propane generator kicking on when a house loses power from the main grid. The ATS's can be programmed on how quickly you want the generator to come on or to switch over. Please don't mention PMM's! There is no such thing. This is not a PMM by any means, especially having to come up with a source to recharge the battery bank. If I could get some input from someone who can understand what I am saying, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Steven",2021,10,1

A big thank you to all those who answered my Qs, helped with tips of their own or just brighten our days with their wise-cracks and gentle side digs.  
I am going to really miss the temptation of pressing the GTE button, of pressing the Climate OFF button, and of the course the temptation of changing the GOM display for the trip distance. Been there, got several tee-shirts, and spent way too many hours trying to get the electrons to last as long as possible. 
It's been a fab car that I have REALLY enjoyed having. I wanted the drop the household fuel bill as the main getting-reason, and it did that on the 50k miles I put on it, saved us loads, helped by at least half my charging being at freebies in the local area/workplace.

"Hi  @gladini  . 
I was also sorry to see my GTE drive off into the distance, late last year. 
We also dropped down to a single car for a few months. 
I quickly found when driving the wife's Fiat 500 that it proved to be more expensive on fuel costs after the fugal GTE. 
Having owned 3 other previous versions of the Golf, I found the GTE was by far the best model with regards to power and economy.  
All the other models where great, but the electric drive in GTE put it right at the top of the pile. 
In only a few short months or ownership, I just knew that my next car would have to be a full BEV.  
I think you may have probably come to the same conclusion by know. 
I still drop by the GTE forum on a regular basis. 
Noticed a lot of the early adopters of the GTE have moved across to BEV's.  
A lot of forum members have greatly benefited from your questions and comments over the time you have spent here.

I think the Mini got away with a high price because it was very fashionable, looked good and drove well.

"On Autotrader with a £1k deposit there are 4 Renault Zoe's that seem to offer finance at under £200 per month.  New & Used Cars for Sale - Auto Trader UK  but these seem to have an additional battery lease that was common with the earlier Zoe's. I am not familiar with how that works, but plenty of Zoe owners on here can probably chip in. 
 
If it helps for budgeting, my electricity costs on a standard variable rate tariff with the current price cap are 4.5p/mile last month and 5.5p/mile in February (short journeys, heater on, etc.) so your equivalent ""fuel costs"" would be £90 - £110 per 4 weeks using these rates (28p/kWh) and significantly less if you can charge on an off-peak tariff. 
 
I am awaiting solar panel and battery install at the moment so sticking with the SVR electricity tariffs until I can swap to a cheaper 2-tier tariff.",2022,6,21

Personally I wouldn't buy an EV whose range meant I had to charge at work to get home. More EVs are sold all the time and your charging spot at work will quickly be occupied by others. It could also be broken or a change of policy at work would render your EV useless for the task. I would want to do the 100 miles on one home charge and would just charge at work as a bonus when you can.,2022,6,21
"40kw Zoe, from around 2017, will easily do both ways even winter. 
Prices are eye watering though, you're looking at thick end of 18k for one, some at that price are even leased batteries. 
Remember when looking battery size, your actual useable is about 10% less, then a bit of degradation on top so factor in 20% off the battery size at 3 miles/kwh in winter. 
So you need at least a 40kw battery to do both journeys in one go.",2022,6,21

A granny home charger isn't adequate for daily charging either. You need a proper 7kw one and without the grant it's probably a good £800 to spend if it's straight forward.",2022,6,21

"Potentially controversial suggestion.  
What about something like a BMW i3? Or a plug in hybrid?",2022,6,21
"I am in a different position to you but went all electric last year. From my experience looking at your commute the first thing to do is to identify what cars have the battery capacity to cover your daily commute comfortably and then how long to put that range back. 
My car has an 80kw battery which gives about 400k in summer 370 in winter. I am retired so do not commute and most weeks need enough for around an 80k return trip or much lower. I can therefore maintain the battery at just 50% SOC most of the time and indeed only charge at the weekend or weds when I have cheap rate as part of my tarif. It could be said I have a bigger capacity car than actually need but I also make longer journeys so it’s range is helpful, but I am lucky enough to be able to run a bigger car at the moment if I wish. The car using the wall box will recharge from 25 to 50% in 3 to 4 hrs and having that facility a home makes it easy. 
I have just been away and used a granny charger in the hotel. I do not recommend it, the socket was very hot and showed signs of heat stress after an overnight charge. There are a lot of threads here discussing this topic. 
Once you have identified cars with the range/recharge speed you can see the coatings more clearly.  
This forum is generally an excellent source of good advice and I have learnt a lot from it. I cannot stress enough from my perspective a wall charger either at home or the school or both would make life easier and would open up the car choice as it may enable a smaller car to be considered. 
I love my car and will not consider an ICE again but they do require a new mindset and some adjustments to get used to. Also the safety aspect of using a granny charger should never be underestimated nor should the installation of a wall box at home. Electricity if not treated correctly is rather dangerous stuff😉 
I am certain you could find a solution to your needs.",2022,6,21
"To cover off a couple of points: 
I'm with Bulb and they have an EV tariff which is 10p per Kwh for 4 hrs over night so try to get onto that if they will allow you to change. 
A hybrid is a mixture of Battey EV and normal ICE technology, generally there are 2 kinds, plug in and non plug in. 
A plug in will give you upto 50 miles of electric driving and if you can plug in at work then the majority of your commute journeys will be electric only with a small fuel burn perhaps 1gal / week. 
Plug in Hybrids have relatively small batteries and can charge safely from a 3 pin plug with an approriate charger set to 1.4Kw or 6A. If you can afford to get a 7.4Kw home charger fitted some hybrids can use these and you will need one for a BEV at some time in the future. 
If you can't plug in or your work charge point is not working you can run on petrol for your return journey at about 1gal per day.",2022,6,21

"Welcome. A used Hyundai Ioniq 28kWh might be best used option to comfortably do your commute all year in all weathers. As with all used cars prices have shot up. For a few grand less a Kia Soul 30kWh would do the job, with maybe 10-20 less miles of range. A personal loan plus the proceeds of selling the current car could well achieve £200 month, adjusting the term to get the monthlies you want. 
 
You’re covering a lot of miles, my thoughts are that the Kia/Hyundai would also be reliable cars to own. 
 
Buy yourself a rechargable power bank / jump starter to keep in the glove box in case the 12v battery every goes flat (EV’s seem more prone to this happening, and Kia and Hyundai would be included in this).",2022,6,21
There's a private sale on the forum for an Ioniq38. They are asking £21k,2022,6,21
"I think the crux of the story is, as with many other folk in a similar situation is that the budget doesn't get what the OP wants in the current market.",2022,6,21
"I have an Ioniq 28 but wouldn't expect it to be ideal in deepest winter weather unless I could charge at work. Certainly it could cope 90% of the time but the odd really cold, rainy/snowy/windy day would leave you struggling to get home.  
 
My son has the later 38 kW Ioniq and that would eat a 100 miles round trip all year round. To consider such a commute you would need a car with a real-world range of 150 miles really. After the Ioniq 38 that would need a fairly recent 40 to 50 kW car to be safe.  
 
Interestingly, if work charging is possible then the commute is actually reversed. A full battery at work would also get you back there the next day so that - assuming work charging is gratis - then the travel cost is nil. But if they intend to charge commercial rates for work charging then you would need to look closely at the various split tariffs at home to see if a 4 hour cheap overnight one would work for you. 
 
Whatever you do I would suggest that any car that is in budget will be the wrong car for your needs. With a 100 miles commute you will need an EV with a decent margin of range so that the daily slog does not have the extra stress of range concerns.  
 
But also, don't forget that you can easily save a lot of 'fuel' money by driving an EV, especially if it's work 'fuel', or 7.5p per kW overnight tariff 'fuel'. And that savings can be put towards the overall budget to run a more satisfactory EV.",2022,6,21
Probably earning extra income via tuition is better than buying an electric car this year to keep your costs manageable.,2022,6,21
"I'm going to suggest that the various break-even calculations are a bit of a red herring. The OP has a clapped out Astra that will need replacing soon anyway, and a long commute that makes fuel costs significant. The Astra won't go 16 years to break-even before it breaks down... 
 
If it was me, I'd be looking for whatever EV was the right answer to manage costs and make the commute comfortable. New MG with a 5-year warranty or whatever they come with? Something secondhand that will do the round-trip comfortably on a single charge (so charging at work is a bonus, if it can happen) - Leaf 40 or Ioniq 38 or ...? Man-maths up a justification for a Tesla Model 3, if that floats your boat? 
 
Iain, you're going to need a charge point fitted to charge overnight on your driveway, and you're going to need enough range to do your round trip on two thirds of the battery to leave some slack for side trips, bad weather and gradual loss of range. Beyond that it gets into what you can afford or are willing to afford. 
 
Personally, when I switched to an early Leaf for commuting I rapidly realized I should have done so years before, for intangible as well as financial reasons. When my holiday rental was upgraded to a Model 3 that car impressed me vastly, but I'm keeping the Leaf because for now it does what I need and the extra money wouldn't bring me enough joy.",2022,6,21

"To answer your original question without offering life advice 
1/ If you get a home charger....it opens up the possibility of you getting a multitude of cars capable of 150 mile range cars that will get you there and back and charge every night 
2/ Ioniq 38 is a great family wagon, even if the styling is a bit ""marmite"" 
 
IMO Stretch the monthly budget and borrow it as a personal loan for the best rate 
 
At 2000 miles a month commuting, even at the Price Cap you will be running at £120-£140 a month in electric ( on an Ioniq) compared to £350 a month ICE 
Road Tax saves another £15 a month as well

Fully battery owned so no lease concerns.  
 
I don't think you'll get cheaper for what it does. I had a ZE40 and it will easily do 100 miles in winter and motorway ones at that.  
 
If you are set at staying at the school you want something that will do there and back without needing to charge at all.",2022,6,22
"Thats actually not a bad price for a battery owned Zoe, but lets be honest here - there is no magic bullet for car ownership, never has been, never will be - there was a brief period where you could buy an EV cheap because no-one really wanted them, and then if you held on to it long enough, you could sell any time over the last year say for a profit - but that's it, just the one opportunity for the common man to come off best. And it won't happen again.  
 
At the most, the OP is spending maybe £4k a year on fuel - even with zero electric costs, it would take 4 years to equal the cost of buying that zoe, even with a cash down, no interest purchase - all this man maths over VED, maintenance costs etc is just man maths. 
 
If you can't afford an EV, then you can't afford it - there are so many noobies coming on here and asking for the secret of how to save a load of money without spending it, and it just doesn't exist sorry. You drive, cars deprecaite, they cost you a load of money - suck it up, and deal with reality, work out what you can afford (which isn't rocket science) and then man-maths it a bit by convincing yourself you'll keep the new car for 20 years and then come out on top.

My first ever trip with 38.3 kWh on 2nd day of ownershpi was 160 miles non-stop in winter, M'way & dual damp roads, minimal hills, 10C temp. Not knowing the car, I took it super-carefully, hypermiled by sitting behing HGVs for about 2/3 of the trip. Cabin heating was on. At that stage I realised I had heaps of range left, and did the last 1/3 at HGV + a few mpg, genuine 60-65 speed. Arrived with 40 miles remaining! So I could have done 200 miles in an extreme emergency. Since then I've been continually surprised by the sheer efficiency of this car, and the way it maintains this efficiency in winter. Right now I'm seeing 200 miles on the very accurate GOM if I charge to 100% SOC for my long trip, and in this summer weather I'm driving at or very near 70 on my regular 160 mile trip. Piece of cake now I'm familiar wih the car. 
 
With the 28 kWh model I'd have no hesitancy whatever in doing a 150 mile trip in summer, and one of 120 miles in winter. If I hypermiled it in winter like my first-ever trip, I'd expect 140 miles to be possible. This car will handle the 100 mile/day commute with no problems. It has very few problems, main one being flakey 12V battery so carry a booster-pack in case the 12V fails you. 
 
If you decide to look at an Ioniq, get EV Watchdog Free app on yr phone, and a OBDII dongle, you can get to see a lot about the state of the HV battery when you inspect the car. Mainly you want to see even voltage across all cells, with max difference of 0.02V, anything more suggests a cell in there is beginning to wear out earlier than the rest, and might reduce range somewhat. 
See this interesting thread for how to get this data & interpret it. Probably works for other EVs just the same, if this app recognises the car.

"I'm trying to figure out what you teach to be honest. 
When I gave teaching some thought, the salary was good compared to a number of other choices but maybe its all gone belly up. 
In your position, I would be buying a new Astra Hybrid, you'll be able to use it mostly on electric but it would not matter as much if you didn't get to charge as the petrol engine would see you through. They are cheap too, especially if factoring the cost advantages of driving such a car. 
You failed to answer a number of questions but regardless of the answers, getting stuck in a flat BEV for hours with a couple of special needs children in the car is not something you should be risking for the sake of saving a few quid. 
Some respondents are correct and some had not given it any thought but it's your decision. 
Assuming you own the property then getting a proper charge point would be a good future proof idea even if the car could be charged over night with a granny cable in an emergency. 
 
It was touched on but if you were to secure finance for a new car you could be better off with that than paying an inflated price for someone else's castoff.

The government thought that the car manufacturers were inflating prices to the tune of the size of the grant to trouser it and by dropping it slowly and then removing it, the prices would drift down. 
 
I didn't hesitate to swap our 2 ID3s for 2 Borns that collectively cost a smidge under £78k, but only because the cost to change between ID3s and the Borns (with almost £6k higher RRP between them and the ID3s) cost £5k to change.

Because of the Gross to net savings and the BIK, and the other little things, it should work out cheaper. Maybe not super deals because the latest EVs are in high demand so sell out quickly, but they should be a good price. I got my ID.4 through Tusker and it was definitly cheaper.

My company has just moved to Tusker from Zenith and waiting on access so will will have a look.",2021,11,1
My company are in the process of moving to Tusker and I'm hopeful of getting a decent deal on a Tesla Model 3 LR. I know that the NHS can get this EV all in with a starting price of £385. Can anyone tell me if Tusker are close to matching this please? I hope they are... .,2021,11,1
Not for me - cheapest M3LR (4 years/5k miles) is 546 net. Can the NHS folk still get them that cheap? I thought that ship had sailed.,2021,11,1
"Yes, I know this was a Halloween offer so it was definitely available up until last night. That was all in for 5k miles a year over 4 years.....",2021,11,1
"That ""from"" price is always a bit misleading - on our Tusker site it has M3 listed at ""from 402"" but it starts at 509 for me.",2021,11,2
"I’m due to start work for an employer who are using Tusker. We’re in need of a 2nd car pretty soon after so curious what prices they’re offering for: 
 
Model 3 SR+ 
Mini (Level 1) 
Leaf (N-Connecta/Tekna) 
Zoe GT-Line 
Fiat 500 
 
Does anyone know rough costs for these? Terms would be 6k miles 24 months or 36 months whichever is better value. I have Zenith prices for these but don’t know how they compare 🤔",2021,11,23
"there is a difference of about £120 pa but for that you get tires, maintenance, insurance. 
 
If you think you can do all that for 120 pa great, its cheaper going elsewhere. 
 
The thing I will say it do the calculations IN FULL, dont just look at quotes.... work out the full annual price for everything to make it equal. 
I know im about £400-500 cheaper per annum, around 40 per month. 
 
oh and you are saying 50 per month, so already thats 40 more not using tusker without the insurance!",2021,11,28

"Hi all. My company are due to onboard Tusker in the next couple of months. With our first born on the way in Sept, and silly lead times for most cars, I'm debating whether to wait for the scheme or get my name on the order list now with a private lease. I don't want to be too long without a new car when the baby comes along. 
 
Tusker price lists are impenetrable until your company is signed up to the scheme. Could anybody who is on the scheme please help me to find out the cost of an Ev6 GT AWD and Cupra Formentor 245 ehybrid VZ2? I'm a 40% tax payer. Any help would be super appreciated. 🙏🙏 Thanks for reading my comment.",2022,4,27
"EV6 GT AWD with metallic paint and heat pump option 10k per annum, 36 months is £955 a month. So after tax savings 40% and NI savings (3.5%?) but adding 2% BIK your pay will drop by £575 a month. Cheaper if your employer gives back some of the NI savings they make (Mine doesn’t). If youre in the marginal tax band where you lose your personal allowance, net cost is lower. Do check mileage expense rates if you do business miles. 
Tusker definitely ramp up their gross costs. But that is a fully insured car for 2 drivers, tyres, servicing, breakdown, courtesy car and home delivery. And there’s no deposit. Includes protection against redundancy and other circumstances where salary is hit. My deal included a free charger through charged EV. I’ve had 2 punctures on my etron, so 2 free replacement tyres and a free replacement emergency sealant. Cost me £10 to take mine overseas (admin for green card). Insurance excess is quite high. 
lead time on the Kia is a whopping 33 weeks. Some cars are coming soon or available from stock and they may be cheaper (probably not right now). They have Audi etron 55 sport (£750) which I have and love. Nissan Ariya (£570pm net) and Leaf coming this summer. 
if you need a stop gap car before the Tusker one arrives look at Onto. 
Due to the higher BIK rates for PHEV cars the Cupra may not work out as good as a personal deal. I can’t get a quote as I’m limited to battery EVs. if you do regular long trips a PHEV could cost a lot in fuel. There’s little benefit in the plug in hybrid technology at a steady motorway speed.",2022,4,28
"Our company introduced the Tusker scheme last Autumn, and I subsequently trawled through the many options 
 
What I found is that for no apparent reason the monthies on some cars are terrible are others are great, and also fluctuate up or down frequently. So if you not too specific about what you want there are some good deals to be had. 
 
I ordered an Peugeot e-2008 GT Premium for £463 gross, which was about the same as what I could find a private lease for (but of course includes insurance (and a wall box in my case)) - then net it's only £295 which seems like a bargain. Ordered at the turn of the year and was delivered last week, about 6 weeks ahead of the orginal estimation",2022,4,29
"Yes, didnt mention it but Tusker prices do vary month to month, guess it depends on manufacturer and supplying dealer incentives. What you can do is save a quote of a price looks good, then you have 14 days to activate the quote and they will honour the price.  
There have been some occasions when prices change after ordering, but with the option to cancel.",2022,4,29
"Hi guys, I need help understanding the tusker scheme. I’m after an astra phev 1.6. Gross salary is 746 and net salary is £535. Does this mean that 1281 comes out my salary every month? Thank you in advance",2022,5,29
"Your gross pay from your employer will drop by £748, you’ll now have smaller salary and car, not just salary.  
Because of income tax, NI etc that is taken from your salary, the amount your take home goes down by isn’t £748, it’s the lower figure of £535",2022,5,30
"here’s an example, hope it makes sense - Gross salary of 2400. from that you make some pension contributions and the taxman takes away about £260 in income tax and £180 in national insurance. You’re left with around £1850 take home pay to pay for your home, car etc. 
 
Now suppose you choose a car via salary sacrifice. Instead of only pay, you get a car and less pay. You get your shiny new car (which you chose with a gross cost of 700 a month), and instead of getting £2400, your employer pays you £1700 gross pay. The tax man sees your £1700 and takes away £115 in income tax and £85 in national insurance. He leaves you with £1415 take home pay going in to your bank account to pay for your home. 
 
In the above example you have a leased car with a £700 monthly cost. But you can see that your take home pay dropped from 1850 to 1415, ie £435. So in effect the car is only costing you £435, that’s the net cost.  
 
Theres a part of the tax rules called benefit in kind. That says if you get something of value instead of wages, you have to pay tax on that too. Its complex and I left it out of the example above. Be aware it’s far lower on a pure electric car, and on an inefficient car it adds so much tax back on it’s not worth having a salary sacrifice car As the gross and net figures are similar. But Tusker do the maths and it’s taken into account when they give you the gross and net figures.",2022,5,31
"Your employer pays you £700 less but gives you a car to make up for that loss. 
because you pay less tax on your new lower pay your take home pay does not drop by £700, it only drops by £535. 
 
the money isn’t taken twice. 
 
Pure electric cars are the best value. Followed by plug in hybrid cars.",2022,5,31
"That was an example into the cost of taking out the car, the point is there is one deduction for the car and then the benefit in kind tax, ultimately costing you for the car 535 taking into account the net result after less tax and NI is deducted from your pay than normal, so in my example it's right. 
 
I have no idea what other benefits or taxable items you are paying so your actual take home pay could/will be different in that case I.e. uni loans etc. 
 
It is NOT going to cost you 700 + 535 per month. That'd make the car VERY expensive.",2022,6,1

Please help me work out what my rough estimated take home will be (I know nobody will have the official answer but just need an estimate to see if it is worth ss)

"@X4dow  
 
I'd start looking for prices on replacements to be honest. Then at least you are prepared. 
 
With high prices but low spares availability it's entirely possible it will be written off as it would avoid a long time with a loan car of some kind while it is being repaired as it's not driveable in that state. 
 
Assuming fully comprehensive then you should get a payout to replace your car as well as the other person's damage repaired.

Increasing car values may mean it could be repairable, it appears that no main structural damage has been done, but headlights, bonnet, bumper, front crossmember, charge port, and maybe radiator/s as a minimum could make it a long and expensive repair. 
Time to read the small print of your insurance.",2022,8,11
"Hi sorry to hear , main thing is you are ok and that's why we have insurance .  
I think it will be an insurance write off, if insurers dispose of it, likely to be sold through Copart, probably economically repairable to someone? 
If you can find a garage to repair it ( maybe Cleavleys EVs?) and cope with it off road for a few months, could be a good option to buy it from insurers ( they will just want rid quickly) . Market value after repair even if 'perfect' will be 25-35% less though as lots of people are (rightly in some cases) cautious of a write off repaired.  
A few moths ago I bought a Cat S repaired R90 2017 19k miles, had been written off, then repaired by previous owners local garage. I was happy to buy it as owner had been happily running it for a long while (I've had accident repaired cars in the past so ok if I know what i'm getting). I saw all photos of damage and repair , very minor still a write off and Cat S (Structural) , 1 front wing and bumper only , no mechanical structural damage , no wheel or / driveshaft damage, charge port ok but flap damage no air bags no headlamp damage, bonnet fine........ still a Cat S write off.  
Yours has more damage , so I think write off cat S .",2022,8,11
"Amazed that the airbags didn't deploy as even at 10mph, that's quite a shunt. Main thing is you're OK. The car is just a lump of metal at the end of the day. 
 
Its does shake you up though. I have only had one accident in my driving life but it was mainly my fault I reckon. I was impatient and ended up overtaking a car driving very slowly in the dark and just as I reached alongside him he put his indicator on and immediately started a right turn - he was obviously driving slowly looking for a hidden junction. Anyway, I was shunted into a field and the whole undercarriage including the gearbox was ripped out. Write off. 
 
I felt I had to get back ""on the horse"" as quickly as possible, but 9 years later, I can't drive past that spot without that night coming back into focus. 
 
In your position, I think I would hope for it to be a write off because at least you can then take the payout and buy another quickly, even if it means taking what's available on the 2nd hand market. Based on the supply of parts issues right now, the alternative, if they decide its repairable, is likely to be several months without your car.",2022,8,11

My wife and I both work from home, I run a small architectural practice. The car is mainly for her to use for running around and school runs etc. She has an X5 BMW ( that we intend to keep), she currently spends around £300 a month on diesel and yet very rarely would go over 60 miles in any one journey. 
I'm going to be using the car quite a bit as well, I'm a self-confessed petrol head and haven't really expected to enjoy it, but really had great fun in the car we test drove last week although with me driving the range wasn't particularly fantastic.

Like the poster above its joining some interesting cars that don't save the planet,2015,12,15
"I really am not buying this to try and save the planet. 
As you might be able to tell from my garage, I really love cars, so I'm doing this probably for different reasons to most people. 
I genuinely liked the design styling of the i3, but I also like the way it drove for nipping around places rather than longer distances. I'm definitely going to try a couple of longer trips with it as well just to see how we get on, but really more of an experiment than anything else. The problem is we have one long journey a month which is around 180 miles each way. I know I could do that journey in the i3 with a little bit of planning, but I can't get everything we need in the car, it's just a bit too small. 
 
I've justified the lease on the basis that we will stop using the X5 for every day short journeys and basically save the cost of the fuel,The cost of the lease is pretty much exactly what she spends each month on diesel in the X5, so one cancels the other out. 
 
I'm hoping in the future, there is room in this world for petrol and electric. Most of the miles I do in the Ferrari or Aston really aren't necessity, the done for the fun of it. I still can't believe how many people ask what MPG I'm getting from them....... the answer is I got no clue, the Ferrari doesn't have a computer to calculate it and I've never worked it out.

AWD,2016,2,16
"AWD is copping out! The point is, what if you have to choose between the two..?",2016,2,16
Is there a difference between ice and ev's concerning which fwd or rwd you choose.,2016,2,16
Voted for RWD on the ground of mechanical simplicity - better aligned to the ev ethos.,2016,2,16
"I really don't understand why people want 4WD on a road car....Not unless your main aim is to race around the roads in low conditions far too quickly. 4WD isn't safer, it doesn't help you brake faster, it doesn't improve traction around a corner, it simply lets you go quicker in low grip conditions, which by definition means you should take care and go slower  . By far the 'safest' drive train layout is FWD, you get under steer, torque steer, more under steer, all of which means when your finally loss traction your likely just crash (slowly), head first rather than side ways - Unless your trying to be clever and lift off too quickly  . 
 
Just watch BTCC if you don't believe me, stupid number of crashes, great fun to watch, but because they are all essentially FWD machine it's all pretty well controlled. Rallying in 4WD cars is just mental. 
 
I blame Audi and their 'Quattro' advertising brain washing of the masses... 
 
4WD is great for this....",2016,2,16
"I would always want AWD on any vehicle regardless of where it is being used and how it is being driven. It is always going to give the car more control if you can not only brake all 4 wheels but also drive them. 
 
It is all very well saying that we should slow down in low grip conditions... and we should... but a lot of the time we don't know the low grip condition is there (black ice, standing water, diesel spill) and so we would all benefit from having a car that is controlled better in low grip. 
 
But of course AWD comes at a price and I can see the argument for a reduced cost vehicle. However, I can imagine a trend towards AWD even on normal saloons as the complexity and cost of adding AWD is lower with EVs than with ICEs. 
 
So, if I were forced to choose betwen RWD and FWD... I'd choose FWD - it is a lot safer in that you are unlikely to get oversteer. Oversteer is great if you are driving fast on a track and are practiced. Understeer just means the turn mushes out and is much easier to control.",2016,2,16
"They make a lovely couple, even with camera in hand.",2016,2,16

"I went for FWD because that is what I have been used to in most of the cars I have driven. Austin Morris did a lot of research on whether to go for FWD front engine or RWD rear engine when developing the Mini, and found that FWD was best. Of course, if we go for one motor per wheel, then AWD (with individual traction control for each wheel) should give better results.

However, I've driven past plenty of rwd beemers defeated by 2 inches of snow and a slight incline and had no trouble with my fwd car on summer tyres.",2016,2,16
"Having driven a large number of cars with FWD, RWD and AWD my vote is for FWD for a normal use car. 
AWD is great for plugging through deep mud, driving through a river to move the electric fences, it's pretty good on poor surfaces when towing.  
RWD gives better traction for the traffic light burn. It gives slightly better traction on poor surfaces. If front engine and RWD it takes up a lot of space in the car, if rear engine it makes the car rubbish to drive on normal roads.  
FWD gives good drive control, takes less space in the car, and in 99% of situations does all that is required. It is so common that there are drivers who have never had the experienceof driving RWD. Those of longer years will remember how the FWD Mini slaughtered the opposition in the rally world, and still holds sway. FWD is taking over the small commercial world , it allows lower, flatter and more useful load spaces. 
 
Since essentially a car is for getting people , or goods, from A-B FWD makes sense.

"FWD 
 
but if I was rich, I would also like a RWD EV track toy ",2016,2,16
"The thing is;- as you specified an EV, engineering dictated it should be FWD. This is so that regen can run at its highest power without destabilising the chassis under deceleration. If you have RWD it is a compromise on the regen because the front friction brakes have to work harder under regen than the rears would in a FWD to achieve stable brake bias. 
 
Ideal efficiency is AWD regen, then you don't need friction brakes at all to maintain chassis stability. 
 
The 'engineering' answer is FWD - it is not a preference, it is an engineering fact!",2016,2,16
"As a self-proclaimed connaisseur of AWD systems I would prefer a system that nobody makes (yet) - AWD with a middle differential (like in a Defender) but combined with the latest electronics and individual wheel braking (think Audi or Subaru, Mitsubishi) and manually selectable locking diffs in all three positions (front axle, center, rear axle) which can be enabled on the fly a la Mercedes G-class/Unimog. That's probably 20K on top of the standard vehicle price but you'll get one hell of car! ",2016,2,16
"Sorry but the engineering answer (for a grocery getter at least) is rwd with rear engine. Drive can be direct, doesn't need steering angle ready cv's, keeps a big bit of metal out of the way for frontal crash/pedestrian impact testing and aerodynamics, doesn't interfere with steering based on torque or regen, allows smaller, lighter front suspension/steering components, gives the best 2wd traction possible, etc. 
 
I would choose rwd anyway regardless of motor location. It gives you options you don't get in fwd and doesn't corrupt steering. The rwd's stuck in snow thing is just complete codswallop. I've been in BMW's in the past coming past stuck Q7's and the like. It's more about the tyres and competence of the driver than the layout - though awd would be useful for the few days every couple of years we get snow.",2016,2,16

Pilots have aids but can also fly without them.",2016,2,17
"One of the main advantages of FWD with an ICE is that when it's winter, and the roads are full of snow, you get more weight over the driving wheels, which are also the steering wheels, so you get more control. With RWD, you need to add excess weight to the boot to even get the wheels to grip. 
 
Now bring this up to date, and we're driving electric cars, and most of the weight of them is slung in a battery pack between the wheels. It doesn't matter quite as much, because EVs have far better weight distribution than most non-mid-engined ICE cars. For simplicity, an EV could easily be RWD without anyone noticing - and CV joint design could be simpler because the driving wheels don't need to steer quite such a sharp angle. 
 
That said, GM decided to build a fake 'transmission tunnel' into the Volt, to hide batteries in, which was so enormous that the rear seats couldn't take three passengers, and the Leaf has rear seats that don't fold flat because the fake transmission tunnel aka battery shut-off hatch gets in the way.",2016,2,18

"I've been driving a lovely mid-engined RWD sports car for the last 7 years and it was an absolute pleasure to drive. I've very rarely experienced unexpected oversteer, then it's been in the wet and actually just easing slightly off the throttle slightly made every one of these occasions easy to correct for. Obviously, a panicked braking maneuver could have been dangerous, which is why I'd also advocating learning how to handle a RWD.  
 
The car before that was FWD, somewhat weedy, but I still managed to have understeer on a couple of occasions from going too fast for the conditions. To be totally honest, that scared me more because it meant there was a far greater risk of coming off the road by not making the corner. That happened once in the wet (at about 20mph!) and I ruined a wheel on the kerb.

Hello, 
 
It seems there is a design flaw in the Hyundai Kona which results in the 12V battery going flat. There are numerous examples on the internet where people's 12V battery has gone flat for no apparent reason. In almost all cases, the 12V battery has been diagnosed as being fine by the dealer, but occasionally replaced as good will. 
 
I have had this happen three times on my car in the last two months and I think I've found the problem. It appears that the rear hatch sometimes pops open very slightly while the car is locked, causing the electronics in the car to come out of ""low power"" mode and draining the battery. It then never goes back into ""low power"" mode as it thinks the tailgate is open, thus draining the 12V battery until the electronics shut down. 
 
I came out to my car yesterday and noticed that when I tried to open the rear tailgate, without unlocking the car with the key fob or door button, the tailgate opened with no effort and without needing to press the button. This means it was not completely shut. 
 
However it is impossible to lock the car without the tailgate being shut. Therefore the tailgate has popped off its catch by itself. 
 
I have noticed that several other people who've had flat 12V batteries have noticed that the tailgate was not properly shut even though the car was locked (which should be impossible). 
 
Could you report this back to your technical department please? 
 
Please don't send an email suggesting to take the car to a dealer as I've already done this and no specific fault was found with the car or battery. Also there are many other identical reports online so there is no specific fault with this car as it happens on many cars. This fault report needs to be escalated to Hyundai's customer faults team. 
 
Many thanks, 
Richard",2020,1,29

"Interesting, having been tipped off by Richard's post and also by messages from the app, I just checked to see if I could open the boot on my 2020 Kona when the car is ostensibly locked and the answer is, yes I can.

I will go to the (very helpful) dealer tomorrow but perhaps I also need to email  customer.query@hyundai.co.uk",2020,1,29

"A pleasant 60 mile drive today, no lights, didn't need the heating on and finally the charging rate for the new battery settled down. I preconditioned the car beforehand and noticed the amber light in the badge showing that the battery was charging. On setting off the charging was at 14.8v as normally happens on a 10 mile journey and it stays at that.  
 
Today the charge rate finally came down to an acceptable 13 - 13.3v. Having watched the video about Tesla batteries I am not filled with confidence about the life expectancy of EV 12v batteries.",2020,1,29
"My boot cover stops are turned all the way in yet it still takes a firm drop to latch it. The stops could presumably be modified to allow more adjustment, or the tops trimmed off a bit. If this turns out to be the cause of battery failures here's hoping a software patch will correct it by ignoring the condition once reported.",2020,1,29
"I've done another test this evening too. I locked the car as normal, then opened the boot by pressing the latch button with the remote in my pocket so the car could ""see"" it. It opened obediently, and I let the hatch drop slowly into place so it's not quite latched, as you get if you don't slam it. The car didn't bing or bong or flash indicators; the display inside showed the rear hatch as being open, and the interior lights were on, but the wing mirrors stayed folded in (which is my usual test that I remembered to lock it). Had this been in the daytime and I were walking away from the vehicle, I would be blissfully unaware. 
15 minutes later I returned to the car and the interior lights and dash display had gone off, but the boot hatch is still (of course) not closed. My money is on the car at this point not fully going into low power mode. 
It's now nearly 4 hours where it's been in that state; I'm about to go down and unlock the car and press the Start button without the brake pedal and see if the 12V battery is a bit lower than it was. 
I think on Friday night I'll do this overnight and see if it's flat in the morning. If so - we have our culprit...!",2020,1,29
"I unlocked the car and pressed the power button once - some of the dash parts came to life (but just a few) and it showed that the rear hatch was open. Battery voltage was shown as about 12.2V. 
I then pressed the power button  again  but still without pressing the brake, and this seems to power up the whole car apart from the high voltage system - lights, heater, everything, so the 12V battery was under proper load. At this point the battery voltage showed 11.7V... 
 
I think we need one of the electricians here to test the theory - stick a current meter on the 12V cable, lock the car with the bonnet, boot and doors closed, then open the boot using the button on the boot lid and with the key in range, then just let it rest back on the catch but not firmly closed. The important bit will be how much current the car takes not immediately afterwards (when the dash shows the boot isn't closed and the interior lights are on) but after that, i.e. when the car looks dormant. Is it taking the same as when everything's running properly in low power mode, or is it significantly higher because one or more ECUs haven't shut down...?",2020,1,29
"Lack of charging when the tailgate is open may be one thing. 
But my Kona had everything locked and still got flat 12v battery twice. I know the boot was firmly locked because I tried it after 12v failed second time (not even the slight ""juddering"" when I tried to open the boot). So it is something else that either drains battery too much or doesn't top up. I think its the second problem as my car did start in the morning, was driven for 20 minutes (which should charge the battery), then parked for 15 minutes and then died. 
 
I collected the car last weekend and the service guys blamed dashcam - I'm quite sure the dashcam is not a problem as I had flat 12v before installing them ",2020,1,30
"So, 6 days after collecting the car from Hyundai (they disconnected my dashcams blaming them for discharging the battery) it failed again. 
The car was driven twice in the morning and then upon returning to car park it gave up the ghost. 
The only think my wife could hear inside the car was some clicking sound. Something similar when you try to charge the car (click-click... click-click). 
Maybe it is some sort of contactor that cannot engage properly and 12V battery doesn't receive the needed top-up??

"I've been doing some logging of aux battery voltage (with Torque Pro) while in ""run"" mode and charging mode. What I'm seeing in both cases is that initially the aux battery is charged at 14.7 V for some minutes with decreasing current typical of charging a lead-acid battery. 
After that charge period in ""run"" mode the average current going into the battery drops to zero but it does dither back and forth quite a bit, seemingly acting like a capacitor on the 12V system. The average voltage reported during this period is 13.0 V but it does dither slightly to higher levels. Continuing on, it's not clear yet after what period the aux battery charging continues. 
 
In charging mode (trickle) the average current after the initial aux charge period is stable and also near zero. The battery voltage sits at 13.0-ish, same as above. 
I've verified that the TP voltage reading data matches the aux battery terminal reading within an impressive +/- 0.01V. 
 
What I'm seeing is that the battery is not charged all the time. But when it is, it's at a whopping 14.7 V. 
The puzzle here is how is it possible to read 13.0 V unless that is the actual ""12V system"" voltage? If that is the case, I'll speculate that the current shunt on the aux battery negative terminal is used to regulate the LDC output voltage (in real time) such that the 12V system voltage suits both the periodic charging schedule of the aux battery and the immediate 12V system loads. 
 
It's not yet clear on what basis the aux battery is charged and whether that's based on the battery terminal voltage (which it knows by the LDC setting a system voltage that produces zero current through the shunt) or a time schedule, or any other factors.",2020,2,6

I'm thinking of running my dash cam off a small 12 Volt back up battery so that it can run all the time like sentry mode in the Model 3. Burglar alarm batteries are ideal for the job.,2020,2,8
"Just to let you know: after 5th visit to dealership (and probably 10 battery failures) Hyundai decided to replace 12v battery. I'm quite sure problems will disappear (at least for some time based on  @Electra Glide in Blue  experience). 
 
Hyundai still couldn't find any issue (including the battery they load tested many times) but hopefully battery replacement will make the car reliable again.",2020,3,9
"All I can add to the conversation is what I've learned from voltage and current logging, while driving and while unused for the past week or two, in ambient temps of 16 to 22 C. 
1) The 12V battery charges for about 10 minutes after each entry into Run, Utility or charging modes, then subsequently is left alone for the duration of that mode with no net current draw. Charge voltage is around 14.7 V. 
2) Unlocking and locking, opening doors, powering on without entering the modes mentioned above all draw charge from the battery, as does the off-peak charge timer as the 'on' time approaches. 
3) If you don't use the car for 24 hours it will initiate the aux battery saver (if enabled), charge for 15 minutes and repeat that every 24.25 hours. It's unclear if it adjusts this charge period to maintain the battery, counter added parasitic drains or adjust for temperature. 
4) The system has an Intelligent Battery Sensor (on the GND terminal) that allows precise measurement and control of voltage and current. It seems to be similar to the Prius, based on a video from the Weber Auto YouTube channel. 
I've seen one incident of the car doing what I can only speculate was a 4-minute load test on the battery during Run, immediately after the charge event.",2020,3,9
"The last week or so I've noticed my voltage running lower for extended times. It used to nearly always be mid 14s but now I often see 12.9 or 13.4. 
 
Today after I put it in the garage and locked it I noticed the PNDR buttons were still lit blue and the orange P light was on, which I've not noticed before. Still on a few minutes later, so I unlocked, started, stopped and relocked ... same. An hour or so later they'd gone out. 
Is that normal? 
If not I wonder if this is leading to a ""problem with the 12V battery"".",2020,3,18
"While charging it should be around 14.65 V. That may be affected with temperature compensation that I haven't encountered during our summer. 
 
 It only charges for around 10-20 minutes at the start of each driving or charging event. 
 Same with aux battery saver events which trigger daily once the first 24 h period has elapsed after the last proper drive, meaning over about 20 min. Shorter drives, moving the car, opening a door, or entering Run mode to check something doesn't reset the trigger or disrupt that schedule. 
 While parked it will should start from a peak around 13.1 and drop slowly due to quiescent draw, normally to around 12.8 before the next aux saver event kicks in. That seems to be the period where dead battery problems can arise as the aux saver doesn't seem to be able to save itself if the voltage drops too low. There is new evidence from one of our fellow owners that each charging period doesn't compensate for prior higher losses so I would speculate that losses due to abnormal current draw can accumulate over several days if the car is parked and relying solely on the unfortunately-named aux battery saver. Eventually the voltage will be too low for the systems to operate. 
 
While driving or charging past the ""charge"" period of 10-20 min, the system voltage will suddenly drop and dither just above 13 V for the duration of the trip (or charge) as the system (LDC) maintains a high-enough voltage as to draw effectively nothing from the aux battery. That system voltage is quite noisy so don't rely on random spot checks. 12.9 to 13.4 sounds perfectly normal for this period.",2020,3,18
"I just wanted to update you all on issues with flat 12v battery. 
Same as  @Electra Glide in Blue  I had increasing number of days with dead battery. After 4th or 5th visit Huyndai finally replaced the battery (although they tested old one many times and said it is fine).

Anyway, back to the point, this car had a button hidden under the dash and if you could not start the car you could press this button and it would put enough charge in the 12v battery to start the car and apparently Hyundai amongst others are now going to do this! Does anyone know anything more about this?  
 
It seems incredible that such a simple feature like this from 30 years ago got forgotten. When I had a flat 12v battery and the HV battery was at 70% charge it was very frustrating that a 15month old 12v battery did not have enough voltage to start the car.",2020,4,5
"I saw that video too. What an obvious idea to charge the 12V from the traction battery. A bit of a ""DOH!"" and a forehead slapping moment for the designers. ",2020,4,5
"I propose a simple challenge, sketched out below. 
 
1 Use a low power comparator/ op-amp as a voltage sensor to detect when the 12V battery voltage falls below about 11V. 
This will be connected across the 12v battery terminals and take a current of a milliamp or so. 
 
2 The comparator/op-amp output signal turns on a simple bipolar transitor switch, which in the ON state activates a wireless doorbell sender, ie acts as if the door bell button has been pushed. 
These door bell transmitters typically are powered by their own CR 2032 cell or similar.

"Had the dead 12v battery for the first time a couple of days ago, 
 
Luckily the small Lithium Ion Jump Battery got it back up in seconds, 
 
It seems I had not fully closed the boot a few days before on parking it up (It was locked but not fully catched, if you know what I mean), and that seems to have stopped the Aux Battery Saver system from kicking in while it was parked for a few days leading to a dead battery 
 
Even having jumped it it did not seem to want to fully charge again and a few hours later was dead again. but I put the car on overnight charge on the home charger and the AuxBattery Light came on and its been fine since. 
 
But very glad I had the small Lithium jUmper battery to hand",2020,4,8
"I had similar experience as  @stageshoot   
Even driving (admittedly for a short while) did not seem to recharge the battery on 1-2 occasions. But most of the times it did (I used to leave the car in utility mode for 60-90 minutes after having flat battery). So it is tricky to figure out what is getting wrong. 
 
Hyundai also recharged and load tested my battery everytime I left the car with them. The car worked fine for about 1-2 weeks and then it happened again and again.",2020,4,8
"This is where ye olde world alternator would have done its stuff. I think the Hyundai assumption is that the battery will never get too low so it does not need a high charge rate. If, for whatever reason (like inadvertently not closing the boot properly - which too easy to do) you discharge the battery too much the charging system will not ramp up the charge. As rompik says even a couple of 50 mile drives will not top up the battery unlike with an alternator. That was my experience as well, hence buying a trickle charger. When I had my first failure and the AA used their booster the guy was surprised at just how low the charge rate was compared with an ICE. 
 
You certainly can not accuse stageshoot of being a low mileage driver which is presumably why he has escaped up till now.",2020,4,8

I guess the accountants ruled out fitting these as standard, just fitting an ICE battery off the shelf.

Because the battery was dead, the charging door would not open so we couldn't connect to the podpoint), so I had to call the RAC as I don't have a 12v battery charger. 
 
My understanding is however that this should never have happened (even with wired in dashcam) because the Aux battery plus was on. No messages that it had even activated.

"Heres a poll for the most annoying and frustrating things you have noticed about EV. I have written this as i have been an optimist around this technology for the past 3 years and i believe that these vehicles have promise. However the manufacturers are still driving their own agenda and haven't made a compelling effort to drive EV forward. VW are a good example of this, they built the E golf and left off 6KW charging which limits it more than a Nissan Leaf and priced it much higher. Fiat built the desirable Fiat 500 EV and then committed to sell it only in California. Ford sell the Focus EV and Mercedes sell the B class EV but both left off Rapid charging. Is this a conspiracy? 
Manufacturers like Mitsubishi, Mercedes, BMWi, Audi, VW, Toyota, Ford, Mclaren, Ferrari, all build plug in hybrid vehicles with EV modes that limit the cars performance and only allow under 25 miles range to be driven under limited scenarios (under a certain speed) without the engine engaging. I find this personally very frustrating as they don't allow the owner the ability to have fun without burning fuel and do not demonstrate the benefits of a proper BEV, preferring instead to engage an engine and add additional power that way. What does that say to the customer? electric vehicles are slow without the engine. Tesla are still the only manufacturer that has made an electric sports car style BEV (Roadster) after 8 years. Isn't it time for an MX5 BEV? Tesla have proved with the Roadster and Model S,X etc that there is huge performance potential for BEV vehicles and that customers, when presented with a compelling product will line up outside to purchase. Hopefully other manufacturers will now start to do the same. Personally id love to buy an EVO style BEV with dual motors, the tech is available today to be able to do this so whats stopping them? The Volt/Ampera is still the only system that allows a plug in hybrid style vehicle with >40 miles range that can drive in all scenarios without burning petrol. This is 2016 folks and that car has been out for 6-7 years. The VW GTE and Mitsubishi Outlander, Mercedes PHEV and BMW PHEV all burn fuel when in ev mode if driven with any enthusiasm or at motorway speeds making the concept a small step forward but hardly a leap. 
 
Ive always believed that a true Plug in hybrid that can travel upto 200 miles on ev (without speed or performance restriction) (like a Volt/Ampera system) and has an engine for over 200 miles driving would be the perfect car for the modern world. It would enable 99% of people to make their journeys without ever using the petrol engine and make a public charging infrastructure irrelevant as people will charge at home or destination only. Manufacturers could even save money on these higher range hybrid vehicles by leaving off DC charging altogether and only having 6kw. I certainly hope the industry goes this way in the future. 
 
Hope you like the poll.",2016,4,18
"Living in California, I have different challenges, but agree with the irritation of manufacturers that market themselves as green without effort.",2016,4,18
"The VW GTE ..... burn fuel when in ev mode if driven with any enthusiasm or at motorway speeds  
 
Little correction ... GTE allows you exceed the UK/Most Europe motorway speed limits in EMode.  
(I've just driven it at 71mph, Officer) . Also you have to REALLY floor the throttle to get the ICE to wake up in EMode. 
(Hybrid, yes it's like a darn hairline trigger like a Prius). But Emode is plenty to zoom off from the lights and make the guy next to you with their window down, wonder why they couldn't hear your engine.

"It's still very early in BEV history.. we are all early adopters here. 
 
My biggest EV niggle - in my geographical area, there is only 1 charging unit per motorway service station, meaning guaranteed queuing / failed journeys if they are down. (Doncaster & Hull 1 each - Scunthorpe & Grimsby don't even have a fast charger at all :-| ) 
 
My second biggest niggle would be people, EV/PHev drivers who misuse charging points, but that is solely a result of inadequate charging units - so you are tripping over people who can't afford to be considerate for whatever reason. 
 
But EV sales are doubling every year, we are going to hit a critical mass in the near future, people will need & demand a better infrastructure, I know this and I am only looking forward to the future! 
 
For 90% of my driving - commuting with very little spontaneity/diversion, my Leaf is a great car, extremely cost effective and above all - tiny carbon impact. 
 
Happy EV'er here.",2016,4,18
"I don't quite understand point 1. . Cars are only Appliances, they are simply tin boxes designed to take people or goods from A to B. The 'style of the day' has proven to be irrelivant in the longer running success of a particular make or model. Look at Citroen as it went from the lines of the Maigret car, through the futuristic shapes of the late 1950's , through shapes like the Picasso and now into a Cactus wrapped in plastic matting. The Ford Fiesta has changed it shape several times, but sells well as it does the job , not because it has a special radiator grill.  
A few makers actually stick to one style for donkeys years, even when the car underneath changes out of recognition, The L/R Discovery being a case in point. . 
 
Surely what customers want in a BEV is a tool that does the job it is sold to do. Good range, good pricing, reliabilty, and a size comfort level to suit the useage.  
 
I for one brought a LEAF for what is under the bonnet, not for its looks. In as far as I take much notice of ephemera such as styling I like to be able to find my car in a car park, I do not want teh stylish but bland so apparent in any car park.",2016,4,18
"A lot of your votable-frustrations come down to the (sad) fact that electric propulsion isn't yet an obvious no-brainer for most car mfrs. You'd like an MX5-E, = a Tesla Roadster for Joe Public. Well, I suspect the Roadsters sold largely to wealthy people who could afford it as a luxury item. Your average MX-5 buyer (I suspect) would really like a Porsche Boxster but can't afford one, and probably isn't going to like the reduced range of MX5-E over the ICE version, and also won't like the reduced cornering and softer ride due to the extra weight from the 60 kWh battery required to get him a measly 200 miles before refill. Plus there's not even going to be space to pack a toothbrush after cramming that much battery into a small shell. Amperas lose enough space as it is, with only a 16 kWh battery, though the ICE could be replaced by say another 30 kWh of battery without too much problem weight-wise. 
 
You'd like a 200 electric-mile Ampera as your ""perfect"" car - so would I! Sadly current battery tech is a bit heavy & voluminous to make this feasible right now. That said, I love mine as-is, and just possibly adding an after-market fast-charge capability might tempt me to improve it a lot! 
 
Once we get a factor of 2 improvement in volume&weight per kWh over current batteries, I think the advantages of BEV will become so overwhelmingly obvious that 90% of car mfrs will have to take notice and stop piddling around with half-hearted phev workarounds, and then we'll see voltec-type decent PHEVs instead (hopefully!). Increasing take-up of BEVs must surely drive competition, and the ugly ducklings will then be easily avoided, etc. Things can only get better, surely? ",2016,4,18

"Glad to have found this thread as I was in the process of sorting out insurance for the Outlander (when it gets here). Its a company lease (my own company) with me as the company car driver/keeper, so I was looking at insurance companies who do this sort of cover One of them I spoke with today asked if I would consider a 'black box' installation and fitting a dash cam, both of which would reduce my policy!",2015,7,28
"I'm very skeptical about 'black box' car insurance. The premise is that the box monitors your driving habits and actuarially adjusts the risk you present as a driver - but there is no evidence that the parameters the boxes monitor are causally linked to higher accident rates. 
 
For example, a driver with a jerky style is going to be rated as a higher risk, especially if they are clumsy with the brake pedal; a slower driver is going to be rated as a lower risk regardless of whether they are actually paying attention. A driver who regularly brakes more heavily than the average is deemed to be a higher risk.  
 
The problem is that matters involving many complex variables are being reduced to simple metrics - something that is always tempting because it manufactures the illusion of control. In problems like this, the greater risk is that the process of simplification leads people to ignore a very important causal factor, and they ignorantly accelerate into a crisis.",2015,7,28

Some (Fiat) can't even get up hills unless you floor it. The stupid box doesn't understand this, it just sees you have your foot down hard on the accelerator and assumes you are a bad driver.

The black boxes seem to be GPS based, having seen some printouts after the policyholder has had an accident. As not all cars are fly by wire it will be difficult to get throttle position data etc but they will have G force sensors like my BlackVue.",2015,7,28

Even the motorway slip road was pretty steep and she had trouble reaching a reasonable speed to join.

I visited Ikea at Lakeside today. There is an Ecotricity charging point there outside the main entrance. When I arrived there was a Fiat 500 in one bay and in the other a Seat Leon. The driver was sleeping in The Seat so I knocked on his window to ask him to move. He refused to move and even tried to claim that his car was 'electric'! Does anyone know if there is a process to report these drivers to Ecotricity so that a fine can be imposed?,2018,2,25

Problem is no one sees it as a priority so nothing gets done and short of having a tow truck sitting at every car park I doubt that will change anytime soon.  
I like the tow truck idea. It would stop very quickly if these rude people knew they would have a much longer walk when they got back but it's just not going to happen. The people who run the car parks want easy money. The people who run the chargers want easy money or grants.  
Neither are interested in keeping the things they are making that money from to any higher standard than absolutely necessary.",2018,2,25
"I don't know what the actual regulations or signs say at IKEA locations but in general, unless there are regulations in place and clear signs forbidding non-EVs from parking in those bays they aren't actually doing anything wrong.  
 
This is one of the issues in Plymouth park and rides for me... the bays are marked for EVs but the regulations do not forbid non-EVs parking there and so they aren't actually breaking any regulations and so parking attendants can't do anything about it. IKEA is a private car park so it is not the same but you have to be careful when considering ICEing... it might not be polite for them to park there but then again they may be well within their rights to do so. 
 
It is really important that the regulations and signs be in place and be clear and for those regulations to be enforced otherwise we don't have a leg to stand on.",2018,2,26

"So after driving only my Volt, and my wife's Zoe since April, today I drove a brand new Volvo XC60 (automatic) for three hours of mixed driving for business. Oh dear. The Volvo's considered a good car - I would struggle to afford one. But the drive was not pleasant, even though it's an auto.  
 
For example, we're used to instant power. In the Volvo you put your foot down to pull out at a junction; you then wait while the engine revs up, then declutches, and the car finally start moving amid a hail of noise and smoke. 
 
The other really annoying thing was unnecessary automatic transmission gear changes - want a little surge of acceleration? Not until it's changed down a gear or two and revved at 4000 RPM. 
 
And then there's the engine start/stop. More noise/vibration. Great, especially in a motorway queue. 
 
The only good thing was the (LED? HID?) headlights. However several times on country hairpins, oncoming cars flashed me full beam, even though I was dipped, so they must have been dazzled/blinded. 
 
I think it will be very difficult going back to an ICE car after driving electric. Be warned if you've only been driving your Ampera for a while. Going back to a normal car you will be shocked.

Going back to my previous car after the test drives (not all at once but they were close together), and it was a nice Avensis, I felt the noise and vibration was so intrusive. I mean, VIBRATION!!!

"Who is the insurer? Have you checked the policy to see what they claim to offer as a courtesy car? Unless they say they will offer something of comparable specification you're probably wasting your time here. Most of them will only cover the hire of a class a (mini) vehicle. So the smallest, most basic car - Toyota Aygo, Hyundai i10, Fiat 500 etc. Unless you have upgraded this.  
 
If it's coming from a hire company, the insurer usually has an account with one specific company so you'd probably not get a great deal of choice there. Direct Line work with Enterprise, Admiral work with Europcar for example to name a couple of the big brands. I suppose you could ask them about hiring yourself and claiming back the cost. They may agree to that but I'm not sure it's worth the hassle and risk of them finding an excuse to not reimburse.  
 
In terms of hire companies. Without hiring from a car club, or a specialist hire company like envision it's limited to a small number of hire companies and maybe only one or two branches. Hertz have one EV in Central London. Europcar have a small handful left dotted around random cities but you can't book them. They just offer you the choice if it happens to be there on the day and you've booked CCAR class (Compact automatic) and finally Sixt have maybe one or two as well. All of these companies and more have found way more success with EVs in their car club brands so most of their fleet was moved over after a short while making your hopes even less likely to come true.  
 
Unfortunately paying for petrol for a while may be the only option. Especially if the insurer decides they aren't up for negotiations on their hire offerings.",2019,11,19

After almost 5 years I’m looking to change my Ampera and upgrade to a newer EV. 
 
My driving is around 9k miles per year, mainly round town and a couple of 60 mile round trips to work with an occasional longer journey. So the Ampera has worked wonderfully for me for this mainly using electric. 
 
I’ve considered a Salary sacrifice car but still can’t justify the cost. Works out around £4-5k pa for motoring with nothing to show for it at the end. 
 
I’ve never spend £15-22k on a car before and have been trawling through the forums. 
 
I’ll ideally keep the car 3-4 years max. 
 
My goals are to find something: 
 
1)with decent manufactures warranty to save any catastrophic breakdowns. 
 
2)reliability & decent real world range 100-150 miles. 
 
3)will hold a decent resale value. 
 
In no particular order I’ve narrowed my choices down to: 
 
1)bmw i3 £15k range, 2015/16 but seem to start having problems esp the Rex, and only 4 seats.  
 
2)vw e golf £17k range 2020 
 
3)mokka-e £22k 2021 with the lowest mileage

Who knows. It will depreciate significantly more certainly,2023,3,9
"If you can get it at the right price, then the LEAF E+ 62KWh Tekna represents very good value, It is a nice car to drive, powerful, reasonably roomy. The top spec has everything you need and everything actually works, there is battery degradation but it’s such a big battery that it is hardly noticeable. Importantly it will do a 100 mile commute in the worst of winter, with no worry at all. 
 
This is the LEAF that will retain the best residuals going forward, however the elephant in the room is CHAdeMO but if you have home charging then you have really good daily each way range without using a rapid charger. 
 
If you do have to use a rapid charger, then in the right circumstances it will charge at 70KW’s and the charging curve at 50 KW’s is flat right up to 85% State of charge. 
 
If you want to do an occasional longer range, then having the bigger battery without active cooling is not too much of an issue. Plus there is less to go wrong with not having active cooling, complicated cooling systems are sometimes unreliable and coolant changes are another expense. 
 
IMHO the LEAF 40 is seriously let down with poor range, especially when degradation starts to bit several years in. The running costs are the same for the 40 and the 62, but the extra range the 62 has, makes it the sort after option and LEAF 40 will be okay for local use but unfortunately the future residues will reflect that. 
 
I can’t see price of the LEAF 62 dropping below £14K / £15K in the medium term for decent examples mainly because of the value of the battery and even with average battery degradation, it will still have at least 45KWh capacity still available at 8 years old.",2023,3,9
"Which of these Ioniq (28 kWh and/or 38 kWh) have app and remote climate control?  
 
That's super cheap for a very capable car!",2023,3,10
"If OP wants 150 miles comfortably in winter, then that rules out Ioniq 28, Leaf 40s, Mokka etc 45s (tho' mfr says the battery is 50 kWh, that's not the  useable  qty!). Dunno how eGolf does in winter, or the MGs. 
 
I terms of holding value, I reckon Ioniq 38 will do well. Not many hatches can do 170 miles in winter comfortably like the 38 can, unless they have 58 kWh+ batteries! Ioniq 38 is the efficiency king, along with the 28, so anyone looking for low-cost motoring in a few years time will surely be after an efficient EV? Which the SUV style ones aren't. Yes Kona/Niro 64s will go further than Ioniq 38, but they're maybe 10% less efficient? Because they're a lot heavier, and aerodynamics are poor. iD.3 58 kWh goes a  bit  further, but I was hoping for a nearly 300 mile summer range when I bought one, as Ioniq 38 does 200 easy enough. No chance, so I flogged it. Ioniq 28 will be cheaper to run than 38, as every 4 years the 38 has battery coolant swap, not cheap. 28 is properly air cooled, and 100 kG lighter, and slightly cheaper (smaller) tyres. Batteries on these seem to have v little degradation, so I think they're going to become the best--buy 4th-hand cheapo-Ev-for-the-kids cars in a while!",2023,3,10

"Leafs dont loose 6% year one not in our climate. Hot countries maybe no active cooling. My 6 year old 30kwh leaf had over 90% battery soh at 6 years and still had 12 bars. Its 7 years old and its still doing 100 mikes in winter pretty much. There have been firmware updates to address the overly large buffers on 30kwh leaf batteries there is a lot of misinformation on this. 
 
Their is a huge thread on this forum on Leaf battery degredatoon trend is around 1.5% a year from memory. 
 
What does matter is checking battery with leaf spy before buying one to make sure the battery has been well managed and looked after. Many haven't. Its also important to look after the battery especially with no active cooling. Lots of rapids kill batteries deep cycling charging above 80© etc. But this is case with all ev. Their was a guy with etron on here with really quite deep battery degredation all be it with loads of rapids and highish miles.  
 
His battery was on track to loose 10% of soh in 3 years on an Audi etron ! Thst is terrible  
 
Personaly i haven't done a single rapid charge in the leaf and its only had 6 from new. Really if the range wont do you a 40kwh ev is not for you.. We use as a town car to run kids around etc i do drive io my sisters which is going on a hundred miles round tripup an down dales no issues. 
 
Looking at prices the ioniq will not depreciate any less than a leaf 40 imo I am sure they are great cars and have better range even. I cant live with looks though. The facelift Leaf is much nicer in and out imo with nore kit in Tekna quise. Now their new model that is a really nice looking car. I would also rather have a British made car with a dealer in my local town. There are lots of factors here. 
 
Both of them will likely deprecate heavily from here though. Old models with a lot of newer better cars in market and coming. Uts proce you are paying through and what you want out of it. 
 
A pretty much brand new leaf Tekna is a much better buy that a brand new fiat 500 as a city car for example. For less money. 
 
Unless you need the range its a much better buy thsn a Zoe as well. Better made loads more kit and a proper family sized car. Its what yiu are comparing it to purpose and what you pay.",2023,3,11
"Ampera is an interesting case re degradation. The highest mileage one (a Chevy Volt Mk1 in USA known as Old Sparkie) has now done >500,000 miles on the road. Made in 2012. It's on the original battery. It changed owners when it had done about 400k miles, and the new owner did a battery SOH test. It came out at about 80% capacity remaining. 
 
It's a Phev (a Rex, really, but most people are more familiar with this term) and has 16 kWh battery in, of which the driver gets to use 65% of the true capacity =10.4 kWh. So it's operating between the 20% charged & 85% charged levels. Yes it's using petrol to do some of those miles, but at most that can only be about 50% of this. Even when ""empty"" and a layman would think ""That's it, battery off, 100% petrol now"" that's not the case, the battery is being used pretty-much all the time. 
 
The motor is 150hp electric, ICE engine sometimes partially-coupled to the wheels, sometimes fully, but even when it's fully coupled it's also charging the HV battery for a couple of miles, then the engine decouples & the next couple of miles discharge the battery. So many, many charge-discharge cycles of 0.4 kWh at a time. 
 
Back to Old Sparkie! 80% of the original 16.4 kWh is 13 kWh, so yes, there's been some degradation as expected, but GM left a huge top-buffer & bottom-buffer safety margin as they didn't have todays experience to guide them & were being super-cautious. But it gives you some idea of what the tech of 2012 is capapble of. 
 
So with today's understanding of degradation improved by 10 years of experience & research, is it any wonder Elon talks about 1,000,000 mile batteries? We now know 2102 tech can do 1/2 a million miles with 20% degradation if operated between 20% & 85% SOC.",2023,3,11
"That’s why I still love my Amp, 2012 car with Bose, hdd, mp3, sat nav, front and rear parking sensors, reverse camera, dab, heated seats, pre heat/cool, and I still get 25 miles in winter and 35-40 in summer.  
 
My life time mpg since owning is 115mpg, and that includes pre WFH when I was travelling 60 mile round trips daily to work. Now that’s reduced so the vast majority of my driving is within electric range.  
 
I’ve also managed to save on the cost of installing a wall box and still use the granny charger.  
 
We’re a family of 5 so this is where the biggest challenge is - when the other ice car is off the road we’re stuck with only 4 seats. One of the main reasons for a change, that and I want something newer/shinier.  
 
Very interesting points re: Leaf vs Ioniq. 
 
I’m only hoping to keep the car between 2-3 years so not too fussed with degrading batteries.  
 
The only reason I ruled the Ioniq out is for the looks and (lack of) tech. I’m happy to pay a few £k more for a nicer looking, larger, with more tech, car.",2023,3,11
"In my experience, if it hasn't already been stated, the LEAF40 is weaker in range than the Ioniq 28, by about 20 miles IMO which makes a big difference and the LEAF62 is weaker than the Ioniq 38, difference being about 20-30 miles again. 
 
Only pointing that out because I've seen some compare the Ioniq 28 to the LEAF30 and the Ioniq 38 to the LEAF40, which is probably based on the ostensibly similar battery pack sizes, and release dates.",2023,3,13

IONIQ 38.3kWh 155 miles = 4.04 avg

"What's more interesting than this, to me, is just exactly why the Ioniq is so efficient, and why manufacturers (including Kia and Hyundai, who obviously could) have not made newer cars similarly efficient. What are the unavoidable trade offs to achieving this level of efficiency in EV design? 
I know people call it the windknife but aerodynamics are only a significant factor at higher speeds and the average efficiencies people claim must mean it is incredibly efficient at 30-40mph speeds too, so I'm not really prepared to accept that aero design is the main thing (edit - I also noticed recently that reported efficiencies for the very aerodynamic Ioniq 6 from early mixed driving reviews were in the same ballpark as an Ioniq 5 or EV6). Obviously weight is also a factor given the smaller batteries, but is it that significant? Or is there some fundamental drivetrain difference that is possible if you allow a lower power motor, or limit charge rate heavily or something?",2023,3,14

My wife took one look at Ioniq and said no. I am not a fan but it was an out right no from her it went no further. Even the Chinese evs hitting market now are far better looking. The Ioniq 38 styling is looking very dated now imo hence why residuals are so poor despite the efficiency benefits being cited. Really the deprecation seems to just as bad as the Leaf 40. They are both old platforms at the end of the day and will both deprecate as such.

In no way should anyone take that as a 'norm' to which they might expect to aspire. 
 
The 'answer' is 3 to 3.5mi/kWh for 'normal' driving (not stupid driving, but with no regard for driving efficiently), 4mi/kWh for 'nice' driving, 4.5 for 'grand-dad' over 5 is hypermiling.

Went for a test drive today in a pre-facelift mg5, 22k currently seems to buy you a 61kwh exclusive with modest miles (17k). Overall reasonably impressed, didn't love the touchscreen and disappointed about the lack of rear seat fold angle.  
 
Also sat in (must arrange a test drive) a 38kwh ioniq. I just love the efficiency of these things, even though the range would be less than the mg. Seems that you can just about pick one up for 16k ( 2020 Hyundai Ioniq 100kW Premium SE 38kWh 5dr Auto HATCHBACK Electric Automatic | in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset | Gumtree ). Boot space wise I was pretty impressed, especially with the seats folded. 
 
For some context, we'd be going from a 2 ICE car household down to a single electric between us. Currently a Saab 95 estate is the main practical car and that's making us overly worried about replacing it with something smaller! We do reasonably low miles per year so don't mind buying something higher mileage, most of our trips are reasonably short with the odd 100+ mile trip where we could often charge overnight before returning.

The Nissan dealer in Kalispell has a single LEAF 40. No discount and it has been sitting in the showroom for at least 6 months. Nearest used EVs for sale are two states over in Washington. 
 
It is 236 miles from Bigfork MT to the Tesla Service Center in Spokane. Model 3 SR+ is not going to make it in Winter. LR should be ok but I don't know if we could afford one.  
 
 
Today's weather isn't too bad with temps just below freezing. Driving to/from Spokane WA in a M3 would be bad idea.",2020,1,28

"I feel this thread allows me to make a confession, in June my Soul goes back off lease and I'm buying a 10 year old 320d auto touring as a bridging car until I can find something that suits (it's a cheap deal off a mate - £1750, its done 150K miles and will be used on god knows how many tip runs as we reach the end of our house renovation). I expect to only keep it 6-12 months max, I may even have the upside of a diesel scrappage scheme on Euro 5's come this time next year to make it a bit of a cost neutral decision. It hasn't been an easy one to go back from full EV to part after 18 months, but needs must. 
 
I would see an example like mine as one of the valid reasons you'd go back to ICE, but hopefully like me with the aim to jump back into EV ASAP! 
 
I should add, I took the Bimeer for a test drive last week over to work, and my god the steering weight and the almost dangerous lack torque from low down took me a couple of junction pull aways to get used to, I was prepared for the tractor noise of the diesel but had forgotten how laggy ICE cars seem compared to even an old Leaf/ Soul.",2020,1,28
"I do have an ICE car but it's an extreme one being stripped out for track etc. 
 
Sounds great and ultimately is faster on paper but in any situation other than track my current EV is just quicker, quieter and definitely cheaper to run. I learned a lot of car related skills building it but I've mostly lost interest in it now and I'm only one upgrade away from making it obsolete even on track. 
 
So no once that's gone I'll certainly try not to own an ICE car for the daily driving maybe ever.",2020,1,28
I've never left. V8 petrol auto is far more flexible than an EV at the moment due to poor charging infrastructure. Don't lose a third of the range because it's winter either. EV for in range trips. Petrol for the rest. When you can get a Model 3 performance for £20k then I might become all EV. Need to put smaller wheels on it though as the 20 inch ones wouldn't last 5 minutes on the roads where I am.,2020,1,28
I too haven't left yet. The BEV is absolutely great for anywhere inside 50 or 60 miles as long as I'm not wanting to tow anything. The petrol V8 SC 4x4 is the nicest place to be on the road (full stop!) but especially on long journeys and when towing. The petrol track cars are the best to use - er - on track. The various diesels are best to use on groundcare (tractors/digger/chipper/etc). No need to compromise just yet...,2020,1,28
"I have move from i3 to 225xe 
I wouldn’t say I move back to ICE, as the i3 just rental from EVEZY, i3 is great little car. 
I am only moving back to hybrid because there are no EV suit my taste that fit my budget 
i3 is fun to drive, decent performance and very nicely build, but I do 40mile-ish each way with mostly A-Road, I need the 120 i3 which is expensive and out of my budget. 
Other manufacturers that given such range do not offer the same performance, fun factor and premium interior design. 
Tesla and I-pace would tick a lot of the box but out of budget. 
The only thing I would miss from an ICE would be the noise it make from the in-line 6 engine and exhaust note 
When a driver EV came out with reasonable price I would have swap without a second though",2020,1,28
Currently running an egolf and a Leon 1.6 TDI in my family. THe leon will be replaced in 2-3 years but with another kid on the way we need something a smidge bigger for longer family trips. For the low miles it does i cant warrant a big purchase price so not really sure. Might have to go for a hybrid like an early passat GTE estate? wouldnt go full ICE thats for sure.,2020,1,28
"My best option for a Montana EV is probably a Cybertruck. Not sure if we can afford it. Dual Motor AWD is $49,900 but that could be Tesla's ""after savings"" price not the real OTR cash price.  
 
No sales tax in Montana and no EV incentives either.",2020,1,28
"I gave my brother my i3 last week, so I am driving my ford focus until my model 3 arrives. 
 
Although I am moving to another EV, I always considered my i3 to be my ""commuting"" car, and my focus my ""fun"" car, and I am loving driving it at the moment. The Model 3 may change my mind about which is my fun car, but I love driving along country roads in a good manual car. They feel more engaging to me than EVs. But EVs just can't be beat when it comes to their simplicity in rush hour traffic.",2020,1,28
"I mean I have a a Mitsubishi I-MiEV 60 plate in the UK and a Jaguar S-Type 2005 in America... my only reason I haven't gotten rid of the jag is because it's so pretty and no one makes any retro cars larger than a Fiat 500 at the moment. I'd really like to get a Nissan Figaro and convert it to EV at some point and long term when the price of larger conversions comes down, would love to convert the Jag to EV as well.",2020,1,28
"Never left either. Currently got a LEAF, a V8 Range Rover and an A4. Quite amusing reading this thread that there are quite a few EV owners who also have a V8   
 
The A4 i've owned for 10 years, its very modified and is somewhat of a fun car. Interestingly having spent years deriding autos, the EV and Rangey have changed my mind. The A4's still fantastic fun with its manual box, but its only fun when you want something fun. Commuting in it now is just frustrating. I usually try to take it to work once a week or so, just so its getting a decent run, definately try to pick the quietest days for traffic though! 
 
Range Rover is a '94 model and needs some TLC, but its great for longer family trips when you want space and comfort.",2020,1,28
"How long is an ICE age?  
 
I see this one ending in the next two decades, for the majority of the heavily populated western world. So about 140 years? It is amazing how long it has lasted TBH. 
 
Moving from A to B and back to A again via C has become a much more pleasurable experience with personal motorised transport, and the use of 'motors' and simplified engineering techniques and alternate fuel sources should mean it only gets better from here on out. I wouldn't go back to using my 1993 Intel 486 DX33 based PC, from the 16 core AMD Ryzen 3950X that is sat under my desk now.",2020,1,28

They will be museum pieces before too long and you won’t be able to sell a secondhand one.",2020,1,28
"Nope, never go back. And my wife says if I ever get her an ICE again it's divorce. And that would mean the M3 is even further out of reach.

"Before my very recent move to a full BEV my previous car was a plug-in hybrid. 
I had that car for 4 years and could not fault it really !. 
After only the first few months of ownership, I knew my next car would have to be a BEV. 
I totally get why people move from an ICE to a hybrid, they are “Toe In The Water” cars. 
Would I go back to a full ICE - NO CHANCE !. 
If I had to go back to a plug-in hybrid, I would see this as a massive step backwards to be totally honest !. 
My wife has a Fiat 500 ICE and driving it once a week, just reminds me of the reasons why I moved to full electric !.",2020,1,28
"As the weather begins to get damper, I am having to try to recall the optimum settings for keeping the windows clear of misting. However, I had an odd situation as follows: 
 
Climate control on MIN, fan on 'Off', temp set to ""LO"" and no other climate usage = Zero on the meter 
 
As above but fan turned up one notch = 20% on the meter. 
 
Is this normal? The climate display was still showing that both the ""ice"" symbol (aircon) and ""rising air"" symbol were ""OFF"" so how can one little bit of fan use 20% of the climate power?",2017,9,24
"Just which zone(s) (screen/ middle /footwell) were active? There is something odd with screen only selected IMO, it turns on the heater / AC even on MIN. Having screen and middle on does not and gives around 5% so I have Min, screen and middle zone selected, fans 2 and the centre vents off, For a quick clear poke the demist button...",2017,9,24
"I find that if you only have screen selected, even on min, the A/C unit kicks in. Probably because it thinks you are trying to demist. I generally run screen and footwell at the same time, with just fan and it usually shows 3% usage. Thats enough to keep the mist at bay for me.",2017,9,25
Am I the only one who's car steams up when its raining or do they all do it? Drives me batty running the AC when I don't need to.,2017,9,25
"Steaming up is common to all cars in the rain. It's far worse if you get in with wet clothes/coat on though. It also gets worse if the car is constantly on short journeys or gets left cold a lot - where condensation builds up.  
It's a situation where simply setting the temp and letting the car get on with it will usually work just as well overall as trying to eek out an extra mile by freezing - you're going to have to demist anyway so might aswell have some decent airflow and keep the interior fresh.  
 
Also check the pollen filter. I've seen so many cars where it's not been swapped - even though they have full history and it should have been. As it gets clogged up and damp it will need a lot more power to suck air through it and will restrict airflow at the same time - both things that lead to misting issues and Vauxhall have a very long history of being sensitive to them.",2017,9,25

"No steaming up for me yet. Like Phil I applied Rain-X to the inside of my windows which is supposed to help a lot. Also, having looked at older threads here I've bought some silica gel (Pingi brand) car dehumidifiers, I keep one in the car and rotate it to a fresh one each week, leaving the used one to dry in my airing cupboard, on top of the hot water cylinder. So far It seems to work, I've had a car full of wet people a few times and there's been virtually no misting. If needed I may buy a few more to keep one in the back of the car as well.",2017,9,25
"Aldi had some 1kg bags of Silica gel at a good price recently (4.99) , there may be some left. These do help to reduce misting.  
 
I also think misting is not helped by the excellent door seals on the Ampera preventing the car drying out   Other cars I've owned were not that well sealed so did not suffer as badly. The moggie van had through floor ventilation which also let out any excess water.",2017,9,25
"I find that if the climate is set to demist the fan will run faster on the 'first' touch of the speed button. I find that keeping the temp as low as it can go without the climate coming on to cool the air, set to Min and having the direction selected to up works the best for me. The climate will bring on the A/C when it registers the outside air as moist and i don't know how to stop that although I have seen during the summer in the heat I was able to run my full 47 mile commute with the A/C on without running out of power.",2017,9,28
"I find the misting worse if I have used the engine on the previous journey, electric only and I don't have much of an issue, just keep the fan around 2 and both top and middle selected, I never bother with the foot well.",2017,9,30
"Update on Misting, Two Ikg bags of silica gel in the car for a month. Took out today and weighed. 1.280 kg each so thats 560cc of water gathered that is not misting up the screen. 
 
They are now drying out and will go back when ready. 
I'm sure these help the misting problem, we've put one in the SO's Fiat 500 nd that also seems to be reducing misting when starting off before the water warms up. Its not a US Electric one, she keeps asking if we can get one though.",2017,10,8
"I keep my one small Pingi bag in the cubby hole behind the shifter, if I remember I put it on the dash at night near the windscreen. So far no misting at all, but early days with winter still to come. I may place another in the back somewhere if I do need to and may buy some of those bigger bags as they are very cheap. 
 
A for drying them out I found the airing cupboard did not do much, only removed about 10 grams in a week, so after looking it up I microwaved mine on 60% power for about 10 mins (850 watt microwave) then placed it in the bottom of the oven whilst I was cooking dinner. That reduced the Pingi from almost 400 gr to 330 gr, which was very near it's new fully dry weight of 325 gr. Apparently it needs a lot of heat to drive the water out, above 100C but not too hot or the crystals break down or the bag fails!",2017,10,9

The worst thing about it is I recently received correspondence from the roads dept via my Cllr after I queried what the council are doing about adding new EV charging points and they stated “At the moment we do not have a map showing where the Council is installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This is because we don't have a budget for EV charge points and are wholly reliant both on external funding, which is bid for annually, to deliver it. In addition, we are also four members of staff down, which has impacted upon our ability to bid for funding and to project manage the installations.”

We bought the Up as it is the lowest category for insurance. Whilst insurance companies are no longer able to discriminate by gender (females used to get cheaper insurance), you can circumnavigate this by selecting a car that males don’t tend to drive. Hence the accident rates are lower and the insurance is cheaper. This is noticeable in that a VW Up and Fiat 500 are low for insurance. But a similar Corsa is at least 50% higher.

That makes it a heavy car already with US style handling and, apart from the cool exterior shape, gullwing doors and stainless exterior, it doesn't have much more going for it. I have talked to a company who have done an EV conversion and it was difficult and very expensive. And I have come to hate the grey plastic nosecone that does not match the SS. 
 
Regarding the Stag, I have one, the engines are not fragile, lots had problems (1970's British Leyland) from new with casting sand retained in the cooling channels etc but the good ones were good and the others, once sorted, are fine.

"They're OK - only that. Our two drivers are of very different sizes so getting the seat back in comfortable position for a longer journey is hard & can give some back-pain. 
 
On the motorway with cruise control is fine - I drop the seat to quite a reclined position and pull forward for easy wheel grip as the travel on the pedals isn't needed. In town I tend to sit upright for the visibility. Anything in between is quite uncomfortable for me - and I don't have much back-pain normally. 
 
So - better than a fiat 500 (never got comfortable) and worst than our old Roomster and Yaris.",2016,9,16

Is the i3 available with electric seats?,2016,9,16
"No, too heavy ",2016,9,17
"Nowhere near the comfort of a 5 series is the answer. You will especially miss the under thigh extenders on a long run because the i3 seems to sit you more legs under than legs infront. The seats themselves are noticeably less padded and really missing side and lumbar support.  
I have no idea why there is no option to get even the basic 3 series seats in there. I would gladly pay the 20kg/seat weight penalty to have ones like my M3 in there.  
I've been looking to see if there is any way of getting the bigger BMW seats in but can't find any info and I'm not about to start ripping airbag seats out to stick some untested aftermarket rubbish in there.  
The seats aren't the only cause though - the chassis is light and moves about a lot more than a 5 which combined with the thin seats just adds up to nothing like the same long distance comfort.  
It also has a pretty wide sill to climb past on the way in which in a taller car can be a bit awkward aswell.  
For me the seats (design and lack of a 5th) are one of the biggest drawbacks of the i3.",2016,9,17

"I've yet to see a fully accurate youtube video. But at least your honest. 
 
Enjoy your £17k with a £30k price tag. The price of the ZE50 is a lot higher than the ZE40, personally I don't think the massive hike in price justifies the partial upgrade in trim and mild facelift. The price of batteries is dropping so why has the price of the Zoe kept going up. As you say the partial paintjob is just poor, but fairly prevalent on many cars. The untrimmed boot is unforgivable, it was pretty poor on the 2012 model but clearly down to a price, but now the price has increased so much it should be finished with a trim panel. 
 
Also a smidge disappointing to see the 0-60. For info flooring the car in Eco mode isn't eco mode, it gives you full power, so the 0-60 won't be quicker in normal mode.",2020,8,3
"Thanks  @Sandy  . 
 
I was surprised when the 0-60 was actually better than I’d expected in Eco, I had forgotten that Eco would probably be over ridden if you hoof it. I hadn’t meant to do the 0-60 in Eco, just with my usual ineptitude I didn’t notice it was on until I was midway through the run 🤦🏼 
 
You echo my sentiments exactly about the poor finish. I will soon be doing a review of a £30,000 car and every panel is trimmed, there are no sharp edges anywhere, and unlike the Zoe, it doesn’t rattle from the trim.. (Zoe mostly doesn’t now that I’ve fixed it, but there is still a rattle from the dashboard on certain surfaces.) 
 
I am a great fan of the BEV and currently see the motive power as being more important than the fit and finish, or indeed price. 
 
But if there is to be wider adoption of BEVs I think we fans need to stop kidding ourselves that what we will put up with is not necessarily acceptable to the wider public. 
 
For £30,000 you can buy for example an A4 Audi, (or lower down the range), a 3 series BMW (or lower down the range), various Hondas, Mercedes C class (or lower down the range), just about any Skoda and various VWs. Look at the fit and finish of any of those ICE cars at roughly the same money as a Zoe comes in at, and unless you specifically want a BEV, you’d laugh at the Zoe and buy something else. 
 
Battery cost is falling so I think it is time manufacturer’s BEV offerings started to up their game, in terms of quality, or hacking the price back. 
 
As I mention, I specifically wanted a BEV and am prepared to live with the quality: but I don’t delude myself that it is a value/quality for money proposition and my video simply reflects my feeling as a private punter who has parted with his hard earned cash!",2020,8,3

"@chris jarvis  sorry fella I don't agree with half of your thesis, but I do agree with some of it. 
 
For some reason, VMs  DO  seem to think they need an EV to look whizz-bang. This might be from the very subtle (strip LEDs on the VWs) to the Leaf. (yeeearh). 
 
But many cars, EVs or ICE, are just whacky cars these days. There's a lot of whacky cars, not just EVs. Ampera is very similar to the Astra GTC (IMHO) and of course the truly Noddy car that is the iMiEV is actually based on a car that was originally a petrol car. 
 
The Fluence looks better than the petrol version, if you compare the two. The extended boot improves the swept line (has a Cd of 0.25 incidentally - thus goes further than the Leaf on basically the same set of battery cells). 
 
But to me the interiors are the really mad bit. For me, the Fluence interior is a perfectly understated set of 'analogue' type instruments and works perfectly. In fact, the e-Up is similar in that respect. I like both of them from the driver's seat. 
 
But the Zoe's dash and interior? OMG. OK, don't let me sound like I am trying to dissuade those that like the Zoe, it's a good package, but you really have to zone out that dash-board bling.  
 
You might also have noticed a trend towards 4 seaters in the car market in general these days. Not noticed? You're not looking very hard!!! So it is no longer a fair critique to level at Ampera.",2016,5,31

If you see something that looks freakishly mis-styled, it simply means it's the future. 
 
The one that really sticks in my mind was the competition between Boeing and LM for the JSF programme. The LM effort looked conventional, but the Boeing one just looked way-bizarre. Again, to me that meant the Boeing was the one to go for - it is the step change that was needed. Instead, US Gov insiders let LM run roughshod over all of the rules of the competition, then passed it. Inside job that was, and cost everyone dear. The Boeing X-32 should have won, and we'd all be better off for it right now - Boeing would have delivered on time and on budget I am sure!

"I love my Zoe. 
The designers have got it spot on- just the right side of futuristic and mainstream. 
Same size as a Clio I reckon, a few bits borrowed from it, but many very clever touches that set them apart, particularly the lights. 
I would say at the moment it's too big given its' limited range- a 2 seat city car is the way forward given that's what most people would use it for. 
Why on earth they made the Twizzy so small is beyond me, on the other hand I can see why that would be useful for students or city delivery type applications, it just hasn't taken off. 
If the Zoe stays bolted together and bits don't start to fall off of it in true Renault fashion, I will definitely get another if the range is extended when the PCP is up in 2 years. 
Battery rental I don't have a problem with, I see it as part of the cost, and the rental of the rest of the car is so cheap. Perhaps if I bought it when the PCP is up (I won't), renting a battery would rankle month on month.

So why Nissan and the Leaf, Hyundai and the Ioniq? in a way they still promise a lot, but actually deliver slightly less, or a lot less in Hyundai's case - so are they just trying to look good, whilst keeping their options open if they can't stop us?

Ultimately I can't see why Toyota are worried about BEV sales as the market is big enough for both. Lots of people haven't got access to a plug due to avariety of reasons but want to drive a cleaner and quieter option than diesel. So it's diesel sales it should be targeting but it sells a shed load of those. ,2017,9,11
"Just bumped into this on FB from Toyota: 
Hi Gareth, thanks for sharing your feedback with us. A lot of the general public still don't know the difference between a hybrid and a full electric vehicle. This is simply highlighting the fact that you don't have to plug in a hybrid. We believe in a multi-fuel future and for some users a full EV will not suit their living arrangements or driving habits. For those users, we have the widest range of hybrid cars on the market. We also have the hydrogen powered Mirai, the Plug-in Prius and we're working on full EV's too:  Toyota to establish in-house company to develop electric vehicles - Toyota . Our long term goal is to make cars that produce zero emissions. Thanks.

"This week when I arrived at the sports centre, I noticed one of the other regular badminton players parking his Lexus. 
I looked at the boot lid to see which model, a 300 hybrid. 
We had a little chat. 
His is the same registration year as my Outlander, ""15 reg"", so two and a bit years. 
Our cars have both done similar mileage. 
I think our cars have a similar purchase price. (he wasn't sure, so may be he is on a PCP ?) 
 
He is quite pleased with his, I get the impression part of the reason he went for it was the reduction in running costs.  
Official figure is 60mpg, but he appears to be quite proud that it actually does about 40mpg ish in the real world, and that he only needs to fill it up with petrol twice a month, to do his 1,000 miles each month. (2 x £70 = £140?) 
He likes the silence of pulling away on electric up to 25mph. 
 
I also do about 1,000 miles each month, my petrol tank is smaller and cheaper to fill (£40).  
It costs me an extra £0.50pence in electric each night to plug in. 
When I'm not doing the long distance holiday trips, I just fill up once a month. 
If I'm gentle on acceleration, I can get up to 75mph on electric.

"wife’s polo comes to the end of the PCP in a few months. VW have been both spamming us with ‘talk to us about what next’ emails, while simultaneously ignoring replies to try and talk to them   
 
We have around £7k to settle the finance and keep the car. Estimate the car may be worth about £14k if we sold it. So either we spend £7k out of pocket to keep the car, or we have approx £7k from the car as a deposit for a new one.  
 
My thinking at least to increase options, is if we’re willing to pay the £7k, we could buy the car out, sell it, and now we have £14k towards a new car. At that point I’m wondering if it might be worth looking at a used EV. Doesn’t need a lot of range, mainly commute to/from the office about 20 miles a day. I’d like some buffer so she doesn’t stress about charging every day etc, and remote preconditioning would be a nice convenience to have.  
 
I’m thinking maybe used e-golf as she likes VW and loves the polo. Maybe an i3 as she liked our previous BMWs but the looks may be a dealbreaker. Or mini. 
 
Thoughts? Sensible thing would probably be to keep the polo so this is more a ‘what if’ as although she has been complaining about petrol prices, it wouldn’t ‘save’ us money going EV and that wouldn’t be the reason I’d do it anyway.",2022,6,30
"Second hand car prices are silly at the moment and especially EV's. It's all stemming from the reported worldwide chip shortage. If I was in your position I would hang on to the Polo, take out extended warranty on it if the manufacturers warranty is about to expire and wait until second hand prices have dropped to more usual prices.

This isn't my original thought but I picked it up whilst vising a Tesla showroom. On my first sight of the Teslal 'rolling chassis' I was immediately reminded of the original VW beetle design which as some may recall had a similar design at the time quite revolutionary. As we know during WW2 VW produced variants such as the Kubelwagen and Schimwagen based on that floor pan. Any thoughts? ......... and I sincerely hope some of our brilliant car designers are reading this.,2018,9,23
"No. If you want things like air conditioning and heating, a dashboard, central locking, windscreen washers and airbags you need lots of -stuff-. There’s miles of wires and tubes in a modern car, that take a lot of care and attention to get right. A coach builder can’t do that without spending a huge amount of time on it (or forging it) and it becomes totally unaffordable except as a hobby horse.",2018,9,23
"Like someone else on another thread, I vote for a reproduction Citroen DS as an EV. 
 
Step forward all coach builders.",2018,9,23
"Well I was thinking of a factory churning out a standard chassis say Focus/Golf size then burgeoning local factories producing the bodies to bolt on top a bit like when UK dispersed the factories for producing the DH Mosquito from those concrete moulds. Hey but I am no engineer. Hats off to those that  are.Bring them on. Electric Mokes, MPVs, pick ups, saloons etc. 
Interesting to note that when the German post office asked VW to make an EV Post van and,they said no.Deutsche Post went ahead and built one themselves. Good on them..",2018,9,23
"The only way this could happen is if manufacturers offer all their EV parts for use/reuse and refit, such that they are prepared to retail a complete drivetrain with all the parts, all the software access details, etc, etc, and can then offer future parts, service and all the other things that go along with running a car. 
 
I believe there  IS  a market for that, but the vehicle manufacturers are not going to be interested until their EV market matures and then stagnates. That is decades away. That leaves independent mechanics to strip down EVs, figure out what all the bits do and how they work, and try to reassemble them into another car, which the VMs will resist as much as they can and offer no assistance at all. 
 
In fact, if you really wanted this to happen, the best thing you could do is write to your MP and ask if there is some sort of future legislation Gov might consider to obligate EV manufacturers to release warranted and type approved rolling chassis systems to build on. 
 
..... I can't see that happening ..... 
 
Coach building happened years ago because the chassis manufacturers did exactly that, all they sold was a chassis with an engine in it. There was nothing more to do but build a separate body system on top. That is just not possible any more, the law simply doesn't allow it to work like that.",2018,9,24
"I would like to think though that a bit like in the kit car world, you could fabricate a carbon-fibre bodyshell, and use the whole chassis/electronics/battery from second-hand EV's; that could happen fairly quickly (Nissan Leaf availability), and is sort of the opposite of what's being discussed ?",2018,9,24
"I can definately forsee a significant change but not in the form of traditional coach building techniques. 
 
I suspect 3D printing and automatic cnc machining and rapid prototyping could allow all sorts of different low volume production run bodies and components to be bolted ontop of standardised OEM rolling chasis. Either from Tesla or a Chinese upstart. 
 
Wouldnt it be nice if places that did that could open up some of the sites of closing car dealerships..",2018,9,24
"No is the answer to the original post, as most vehicles are no longer purchased. Just borrowed for a few years with multiple routes to pay for it. Special one offs are only the option for the few who have large sums of cash to burn and dont have to finance it by leasing for three years. 
I would love to think the specialist vehicle industry will continue to thrive in the UK, and recent events have assisted in making us a cheap place to get such things carried out at a world level, but much more expensive in our country as costs of imported parts have gone up significantly.  
Dont forget, TESLA doesnt actually have a chassis, what you see in the pics and in the showroom is just the lower floor structure which with the main structure is all part of the monocoque body shell. Its not a separate part. 
I have been asked about doing a Caterham style car with 150miles range, but the real issue with a small compact lightweight car is stuffing enough cells into it to deliver peoples expectations. A 30kw pack will weigh over 1/3 tonne. Things like the caterham just arnt designed for such weights. The tesla doesnt weigh 2 tonnes + for nothing.",2018,9,24
"Since there are already shed loads of unwanted mainstream cars that cant find a new owner after lease no1, I find it hard to see how any lease company would lease a specialised one off ego trip, which would have an unknown residual, and probably be impossible to move on. If you can afford a one off then you probably wont finance it or part with it. And its probably going to be way outside the pockets of mere mortals.  
Its not as easy to ""strip off"" an unwanted body and simply replace it. And certainly not something thats going to be anywhere near cost effective. You dont see many Mk1 or 2 range rivers getting re bodied. Perfectly reasonable to do so. Except the people who have the money want the latest version, with the new warranty, the new features and a new registration year plate.",2018,9,24

Coach building eh! I always find it amusing when an advert for a second hand car describes its lovely 'coachwork'.,2018,10,26
"Bit like the Tesla frame, its not a chassis in its own right, but the floor pan part of a monocoque shell. Its structure isnt separate from the body shell and isnt a structure until the rest of the car is added. You cant readily take this out of a car, its just some parts of the body structure to illustrate a point , just like the Tesla frames with the pack etc. This is not like the old beetle chassis pan onto which a body structure was added.  
Most groups of companies, like VW Fiat etc share floor pans across a number of vehicles (and group companies), this hastens design and tooling costs, and in VWs case they have used the old version of a structure on lesser value vehicles, ie early VW era skodas, were based on the old series Golf/ passat floor pans, so ensuring value separation, but capitalising on established design and tooling. Many makers work on a 6 year cycle, so they design a vehicle, and plan at least one update, half way through its life, while working on the replacement floor plan / vehicles for the subsequent replacement ranges. 
Ford share a lot of design with Mazda, and in the past before they sold it off some Volvos shared floorpans with the Focus, and some Fords got the Volvo engines. The second generation KA ws basically a Fiat 500 with new panels and identity.  
But back to the original thoughts of this thread, normal cars are not something that you can readily separate the chassis and running gear from the body shell (That icludes Tesla and Leafs). Its possible with some vehicles, where they do have a separate sub structure, but they are few and far between, like Lotus, the New London Taxis, some Alloy chassis / plastic bodied cars, but none are exactly a common vehicle, or one likely to be cheap and available as a doner vehicle.  
If you look at the I3 it has a carbon fibre structure, with ally subframes and no load bearing panels. Not something you could cut up and re use. 
 
The street rodding and custom industry goes back to the 20s when people took cheap cars stuffed in a big engine and then went and raced them on salt lakes. A few then made it onto the road, and since the 50s whole segments of specialised parts and car building companies have appeared. But its not cheap, you can get a full frame to the replace the one in your 1950s shoebox, it will take a Ford modular or Chevy Vortex engine, and can be ordered with latest Gen Corvette suspension. But your build of such a car is probably in the £100k area.  
Over time this industry in the states will move to supply chassis to take Tesla Drive trains, some already can . But Here in the UK, its a limited market. The cost of hand building a vehicle us huge. Yes there are a lot of very beautiful works of art out there, but most are built by their owners or belong to people who dont have issues with spending £100+k on a on off car. Some even collect, Jeff Beck has a number of 32 ford street rods, that he builds, any one would set you back the price of a well specced newTesla.",2018,10,26
"So I’ve had my Ampera for not far short of a month, I’ve done around 700 miles, the majority around town, and those included the 180miles of range-extended driving on the way back from the dealer. I’ve created, purely for my own interest, a spreadsheet where I can enter the miles driven, KWh used, and Petrol, it can work this back to a cost per mile, and an equivalent mpg based on the current cost of petrol/diesel. I understand that it’s winter, tougher on batteries, and the best I can get is around 33miles from a charge, with careful use of heat, and sedate driving. So far, this car is finding it tough to match the long term 53mpg of my diesel, (or about 10.5p per mile)..... which I’m slightly surprised about. You have to do a ‘lot’ of electric miles in this car to make a significant fuel saving over a diesel.....it is however a lovely car, and it’s nice to know that I’m not polluting quite the same as my diesel motoring

Have you factored in the saving in vehicle excise duty?,2018,12,20
"Back in the others again, there is an Ampera forum under general motors.  
 
Some thoughts  
 
Winter I get @30 miles to a charge which is 12kWh allowing for losses or about 6p mile. Summer 50 miles or about 3.4p on my tariff. My old laguna did 43mpg unless on a long run. The amp is cheaper and less falls off it over the years. Servicing is cheaper as is insurance and ved, and the tyres last better. 
Oddest thing is depreciation. This is the only car I've ever had that has not plummeted in value but is currently holding its own despite me putting 30,000 miles on it 
 
Running on petrol @45mpg once warmed up usually less as it's a short warm up in winter and get me the last few miles home so I can recharge. 
Short town journeys in winter where the car cools before being used again will kill the range as the heater is always on. On longer trips the heater gets warm then just tops itself up.",2018,12,20
"thanks for your replies, re excise duty, sure, I do bear this is mind, but its rather cancelled out by the fact that this car is more cost to insure compared to my previous 1.9td Skoda. 
 
My daily driving is a rather short journey to work, of 2 miles, or 1.3 miles depending on where I am overnight, I then drive around the local streets for work, no long distances, and I can charge at work between calls. The majority of my driving is within the electric range, however today I drove to Knutsford, managed 27 miles electric, had to use heat because somehow I failed to get the preconditioning to work. I had my charge finish 35 minutes before departure, and climate set to the appropriate heat, then I locked the car (seem to have to do this regardless that it's already locked) and started the preconditioning via the key fob, and saw the lights come on. After 25 minutes, upon getting in the car, it was stone cold inside, not a clue what happened there. After the electric range was gone, my 55mph to 65mph cruising netted me 49.1mpg with no drive mode adjustment, just stayed in 'normal' 
 
Forgive me, the last time it was mentioned about posting in General Motors, I went to the US GM Volt forum, oops. I will find the section you suggest on this site 
 
tomorrow I'm off around Liverpool, not sure on the complete distance yet, but it will be my first day of rather mixed driving, then I should be back to doing a lot of town work over Christmas which will be well within the Amps range 
 
I wonder if my many short journeys and continuous top ups mean that with battery balancing, or slight loss overnight, that my short town journeys are adding up the small wastages, and giving me upwards of 10p per mile, like my diesel ? 
 
It's certainly an interesting experiment 
 
Donald..... could you link me to the content you suggest, you have a lot of content ! I can possibly find it if you tell the the title ? - Thanks",2018,12,21
The problem with lots of short electric trips is that you are spending most of it on just reheating the cabin. Heat is 'free' in an ICE (albeit you have to wait for it to come through).,2018,12,21
"Thanks Donald, I understand what you mean, but I've kept the heat to a minimum, using the heated seat, and the defroster, such is my excitement for my new car that I've been occasionally freezing myself in pursuit of something more than the 33 miles I've gotten out of a charge so far !  . a lot of the short trips have neither had heat on, or even been preconditioned. 
 
I am however working on a 'worse case' scenario, where I'm more or less forced onto a day tarrif, and I include the vat, and take the consumption from the plug rather than what the car reports. 
 
Maybe things will level out in time perhaps",2018,12,21
"Lots of short trips knocks mine at weekends, shopping, errands etc. Sub 30 is not unusual, long runs as in the commute 17 miles each way and no charging at the office even at 0 gives 35 plus. 
Pre-conditioning. the sequence is lock then precondition button. I think that if the climate is on min then it will not warm the cabin if the ambient is over 8 roughly. Leave the climate on eco or max at 22 or 23 and it will warm the cabin.

Actually mine is a sort of muddy, streaked colour currently. The roads around here are mucky and the paint on modern cars is so thin now I'm wary of washing it - thats my story anyway.   
 
And turn the climate to min once started - the precondition is enough for a few miles. 
 
As an aside SWMBO's fiat 500 which does very little mileage (62 plate 8,500 miles) is miserable on fuel as it never warms up which is a problem for the consumption, it is very good if I take it out for a run to scare the inhabitants of the exhaust pipe  
I would expect the AMP to do better than an ICE in the short journey stop start type usage but it will not return the 40-50+ miles per charge a continuous run will give.",2018,12,21
"yeah, I've had mine for a month now, washed it twice I think, but we're certainly heading into that salty/dirty roads time of year when whilst there's probably little point in washing it, it realistically the most important time. 
 
After a month of spreadsheeting (is that a word?) I've 955 miles completed, 3 runs were reasonable lengths on ICE, 3 times I've fuelled up, I wouldn't even know if this car goes faster than 60mph, and I'm about two thirds of the cost was petrol, the balance was electric, total spend of £100.50 for the Ampera against what would have been £102.00 for my old 1.9td. 
Things may be different next month as I'll possibly have less range extended miles, and maybe when we're into spring and the outside temperature is a little higher, that might make a difference too. 
I had many years using a fuel tracking app, and I found it interesting to compare my different vehicles, clearly a straightforward fuel tracking app is useless for a car that uses two forms of energy, hence the spreadsheet... and it's just for fun. I'd hoped I could crack 100mpg equivalent, so far I'm between 53 and 58mpg depending of whether you're comparing gallons of petrol or gallons of diesel * 
Some would say that when you're using an E7 tariff, you can run an EV for a lot less, but I'm a firm believer in that the electric company just artificially inflate your daytime rate to compensate.... but no use for me, I'll always charge at work, and take the car home full SOC. 
I'm liking the car very much indeed, a very clever piece of kit, and it's nice to know that at least as many miles as I can manage are electric and less polluting

Here's a response from Drive EV Project, Development Team, Cornwall Development Company:

They say you will either need to sign up to the SSE RFID scheme, the cost will be a one off £20.00 to register and get an RFID card...... 
 
The cost to use the rapid chargers is set to be £4.00 for the first 15 mins (minimum charge) then £0.25 per minute thereafter......."" 
 
My reply included the following: 
""Based on my own car, which is a typical EV, the cost would be equivalent to 66 miles per gallon of petrol/diesel. 
The calculations for this are: 
15 min charge using a rapid charger = 60% car charge capacity at best.  
60% charge capacity is equivalent to approx 44 miles 
£4 for 44 miles is £6 for 66 miles  
Diesel/Petrol at approx £6 per gallon provides upwards of 50 mpg. Modern petrol and diesel cars can get up to 70mpg. 
So, for the convenience of a longer range and quicker journey I would opt for my diesel car to journey beyond my EV range of around 40 miles......""",2014,10,21
"I spent some time looking at the Western Power Distribution tariff sheets. One issue with the very high quick-charge price may be that these EVSEs can rack up very high demand charges, which are assessed separately from the per-kWh usage charges. I'm not certain about this, but it could be that the high charges to EV drivers embed high distribution costs. 
 
Still, I find this issue to be amazing. Here in the eastern U.S., the vast majority of L2 and L3 charge points are free, funded by the business that hosts the charger. If you're driving your Leaf in Tennessee (home of Nissan's Leaf factory), you can charge free at Cracker Barrel restaurants around the state.  
 
Another model is for the car companies themselves to carry the water of the charging system. Nissan has at least L2 and some ChadeMo charging at all its dealers, which provides a nearly comprehensive network. Tesla is building out its SuperChargers. 
 
So, maybe we'll be better off looking to the private sector rather than flawed government schemes.",2014,10,21
And that makes the Local Authority rapid charger schemes a waste of money - the taxpayers' money you mention in a lot of your posts. There is no point in spending this money unless the things are used - even if it's at a further loss.

"The Essex ones charge a £5 flat fee. They were installed using public money and I'm guessing they don't get a lot of use because of the £5. Everyone in a Leaf who lives in Essex is within easy range of free chargers no matter what direction they go in if they charge to 100% before leaving home. 
 
I have no problem with paying a reasonable amount (and I think 33p per kwh is at the high end of reasonable) when out on the road, but the later providers of rapid charges ought to see what the major players (Ecotricity and Nissan dealerships) were already doing before setting a fee.",2014,10,21
"I'm not saying the government haven't done anything, but I'd love to know what they have done most effectively. I'm not saying that in an adversarial manner, I'm genuinely interested.

 Would GM have been selling me the car at £28k (as opposed to the £23k I bought it at) if the grant didn't exist? 
 How many people 'grabbed' a charger because it was free. A chap 3 doors down has one and I know he has no intention of getting an EV. He got it because it was free and thinks it will add value to his house/increase its sale-ability. 
 As far as I can tell, the Electric Highway was put in by ecotricity in spite of (not because of) government...who thought slow/medium charging in town centres was the key to encouraging adoption. 
 
Also, from what I understand, the grants for charging infrastructure appear to be fragmented and a confusion for the 'average' (use mean, median or mode  ) motorist.",2014,10,22

"I probably sound like a broken record but I do think Tesla have the right idea, install a network with (essentially)borrowed cash, then give your customers the choice, don't pay for access if you don't want to, or pay ~£1500 for unlimited access. You skip the whole quagmire of time vs consumption billing, (and actually once you reach ~15k miles your price per kWh is only about 30p) and the customer just has one easy decision to make. 
 
I mean if Nissan today had an unlimited usage network with rapids every 40 miles on every A road and motorway in the country, would I pay £1500 to join it? Yep! I've already driven about 1,500 miles on rapids since March and would have done lots more if the network was there.(like the trip to the Leaf factory which I had to do in my girlfriends fiat 500...!)",2014,10,22

25 miles at 61mpg (my average) in petrol would cost £2.33.

Hampshire County received £315,000 to install rapid chargers, so the only significant cost of running these things must be the back office and sending a chap out to fix them, which Ecotricity and CYC seem to be able to do very cheaply and easily.

Maybe this is the way forward - chargers installed and managed by energy and other companies as an adjunct to their core services (I doubt SSE will win any new customers with their approach to charging).

Or they announce the money, the numbers, and then the partner.

••• The anticipated costs breakdown

"By best location I meant by major roads, not in my back garden! Or as the OLEV puts it in its guidance document "" Placing rapid chargers at key points on, or close to, the strategic road network, for example at motorway service stations, will help to reassure EV drivers that they can undertake longer journeys as easily as if they were using a conventional vehicle."" 
 
The HCC rapids are bunched together, and in locations that you have to drive to as a destination rather than would drive past on your way to somewhere. There are long stretches of duel cartridge ways with no rapids as all in Hampshire , the A3 for example, and much of the M27. In my opinion places like town centre car parks are completely the wrong place for rapid chargers and would be much better served by more , cheaper slower chargers as you are likely to be parked there for some time. This is the same for PHEVs or EVs. 
 
Tax payers money should be spent on building a rapid charging network on dual carriageways and motorways, even if it means upgrading the power grid. This would encourage people to switch to electric cars, it might be better to give the OLEV funding to the highways agency, as councils are only responsible for local roads.  
 
Dumping them where there is capacity on the grid and not switching them on is a waste.

"Here is the FOI response from HCC, apparently it was always SSE installing the chargers and they were going to use CYC to run the back office. Daniel Hunt emailed me for HCC in June saying they would be on the CYC network. 
 
It does say that the prices (set by SSE) have to be not be set unreasonably high compared to other local chargers, and at a reasonable level according to current market rates.  
 
I am not sure how SSE can get away with charging so much close to free Ecotricity chargers under these rules.

Specifically that SSE, and not the council nor any publicly accountable body, can have complete control over EV charging prices. Moreover, they take 100% of the revenue.  
 
So once again it seems that the OLEV funding is bolstering private companies coffers to the exclusion of the interests of EV drivers and the public... who don't forget is funding the OLEV grants. 
 
This for me is the biggest failing of how the OLEV funding has been handled. It seems to me that there has been very little concern to ensure that grant-funded assets are retained on the public balance sheet or that future revenues benefit the public bodies which supposedly run the services.  
 
In fact, HCC seem not to be involved except as a conduit to claim the money and then spend it. After that the running, maintenance, fee charging and setting of prices, fee collection, profit and management in all respects are with SSE. 
 
Basically it is a conn. We, the public assume that our councils are providing services on behalf of the community when in truth they have almost nothing to do with running them.

"Until longer range EVs get cheaper, you could consider an Ampera. At this time of year I get 30 miles electric range, and if you can get a 13A socket at work you could recharge (7 hours) to get 30 miles going home. These are about 10-11K £ these days. 
 
Suppose you can't recharge at work, your 80 miles/day becomes 50 petrol + 30 electric. Expect to get 45 mpg in summer, let's say 40 in winter, and suppose electricity is 15p/kWh; it takes 12kWh to recharge so £1.80 leccy + 1.25 galls petrol/day. so 4.5l x (50/40) x £1.20 = £5.62 petrol/day. So total cost appx 5.6+1.8 = £7.40. If you have E7 electricity at say 7.5p/unit (a guess!) this halves the electric cost to £0.90, so daily cost £6.50 appx. 
 
If you can recharge at work, costs drop dramatically; in summer you'ld do it all on electric, in winter 3/4 of it electric. 
 
Ampera is a v comfortable car for cruising in, will do 80 on motorway continuously if you want. It's reckoned to be quieter at speeds when the ICE is running, than the i3 Rex. And probably cheaper than i3 Rex as it's an older car. Electron model has nice sound with Bose speakers, but have never heard the standard ones in the Positiv so no idea what difference.

"Hello. Want to buy an EV or possibly a hybrid and don't want to spend more than £20k. Would consider buying a second hand (1 yr to 18months), if it meant I could buy a better car with more tech options, better interior etc. I'm not a ""car snob"" and see them only as an aid in getting from A to B, but want some comfort. I have done a little bit of online research and would love to go totally EV, but am a bit frightened about the mileage range currently available, so the BMW i3 sounds interesting. I would ideally love a 5 seater, so the Nissan Leaf appeals on that front and hear they are very popular. The Renault Zoe also appeals budget wise.

The Leaf and Zoe have large discounts and finance contributions, so the depreciation isn't  quite  as bad as it appears! A lot of people buy on PCP so know exactly how much it will cost and don't have to worry if residuals get worse.  
 
It will probably help members provide more focused advise if you explain how much you drive each day, how many longer drives you do (with examples) and confirm you have private, off street parking.",2017,7,1
"Hello  @Jan Morris   
 
Welcome to the forum, it's a great community on here so i'm sure you will find shortly some other members will give great advice! In regards to your price budget and the age of vehicle you want, you have got quite a bit of choice which is good. As you have mentioned the i3 is a great vehicle and sounds like could be an option for you, whether you decide to go for an i3 with the REX (Range Extender) or the BEV version (Battery Electric Vehicle) would depend on your daily journeys and types of commutes, in most incidences a BEV i3 could be suitable but its always an added luxury to have the assurances of the range extender! What is your typical daily journey? The i3 Rex will do realistically 70-80 miles on electric and another 70-80 miles using the petrol giving you a combined range of 150 miles. One thing you will find if your daily mileage is low, you will only find yourself charging up a couple times a week. So its good to remember if you decided to charge everyday (overnight) you wake up in the morning and the car has got 100% and you can carry out another 80-100 miles etc.  
 
The Nissan leaf is one of the most popular electric vehicles on the market, you have a good choice on the used car market and yes they have the 5 seats compared to the i3 which has just 4 seats. When looking at the Leaf's or Zoe's keep an eye out whether they are battery owned or battery lease, I wont go to much into detail about this but preferably if you can buy a battery owned vehicle this is better. There are many threads talking about this.  
 
The Fiat 500 yes these are in america, I do not anticipate these coming to the UK anytime soon. Unless other forum members have heard different.  
 
Buying a second hand EV is a great way of getting into an electric vehicle at an affordable price. I run an independent electric vehicle specialists based in Camberley, Surrey. I will put a link to my website at the bottom. On there you will be able to see a few different EV's I have got for sale and at various price-points. Your more than welcome to give me a call anytime and ask as many questions as you like. Hope this helps, I'm sure some others will be along shortly to give there great advice also.

"As  @andrew*debbie  says, cash is no longer king in the car world! Almost all purchases are financed, so people compare repayments rather than cash price. This means that dealers often offer better deals on finance! Even on used, Nissan offer £1000 towards finance but you could take out and pay off almost immediately. 
 
The UK has far more plug in cars than France, so I am not sure why you think it would be better there? There are threads here on people taking EVs to mainland Europe including a recent one in an i3 REX.  
 
A charger with a 13A plug (not included with Zoe) is really intended for when visiting family and friends as all manufacturers encourage the fitting of a dedicated charger. With Zoe and Leaf a dedicated charger is free thanks to manufacturers and the OLEV grant.

"Welcome to SpeakEV  @Jan Morris . 
 
Having just bought a one-month-old used Leaf, I can say with certainty that there are huge savings to be made buying a nearly new Leaf for cash from a Nissan dealer, getting all the warranty benefits, etc of buying from a franchised dealer.  
 
You would be well within your budget and I think now is a great time to buy because dealers are scratching around for deals before the new registration plate in September. Do an Autotrader search on 2017 electric cars to confirm – you'll see there are plenty of nearly new Leafs with low mileages available currently. 
 
I suggest you start showing interest on a specific car around the middle of the month and make a sporty bid on the car you'd like, being very clear that you will take delivery this month and there are other cars that meet your requirements available. If the dealer doesn't accept very quickly then try a different dealer. 
 
I've taken the 80/20 approach to choosing my new car. My Leaf will do 80% of the things I need and I'll find other ways of doing the rest (e.g. Uni runs, fly/drive to France, etc.) which will cost me less than if I'd chosen a different car. 
 
The other point I'd make about depreciation is that many of the people buying EVs are very tech-orientated and want the latest model with the newest features so there has been an oversupply of used cars. From an owner perspective, most of these cars were financed on PCP deals so the owners haven't taken a big financial hit – quite the contrary they will have saved money compared to running a petrol/diesel car. 
 
If you buy used, to a large extent, the depreciation will be offset by your saving in fuel costs. When thinking through how to replace my first Leaf, and wanting more range, I couldn't face the depreciation plus the cost of petrol for 10,000 miles per year! That's what put me off Toyota hybrids! 
 
As others have said, get a dedicated charging point installed near to where you park your car at home.",2017,7,2
"Hello again Lewis, sorry I am late getting back to you - got back late from day out yesterday. 
 
Your reply was very helpful - beginning to build up some useful information which will help me decide which brand and model to go for. I do very low mileage in the week, but a bit more at weekends, but no more than about 6k a year on average. I may not need the BMW i3 REX, but would like to test drive one to make sure. The Nissan Leaf sounds more me than the Zoe and I like the idea of the extra space, but I can park anywhere with my current car (Aygo) and so a larger car might be a bit of a shock. I keep hearing of other cars about to come on the market (think all manufacturers must be really pulling all the stops out now as so many more people in the UK now seem to be turned onto the thought of buying EVs) -  Six new electric cars coming for 2018 and 2019  
 
I will arrange some test drives locally this week as I don't really fancy driving to Surrey to be honest and I would prefer to deal with a local dealer for convenience, but may be in touch if I can't find a good deal. It's always been difficult buying a new car as I do find a lot of sales people unwilling to do a good deal with a woman, which is why I may take a male friend with me in the hope that sales staff will not be patronising and will offer me a better price. Thank you very much again though for replying to me and for the useful info. May be in touch.",2017,7,3
"Here's my ""off the wall"" punt. A cheap second hand leaf on a £130 down and £130 per month PCP for 2 years and rent a very cheap car if you need to go more than 200 miles in one day which will probably boil down to a few days per year. That will leave you the thick end of £17000 in the bank. Interest of £1.72 after tax over the next few years and put a deposit on a Tesla M3. That will do all your mileage requirement and be a very cool car. You can justify the PCP payments by the fuel savings WHEN your mileage triples to 15k pa due to enjoying driving again now you are in an EV.  
 
On a more seriously note, a cheap PCP as above would be a good starter if you dont do much mileage and perhaps want to dip your toe in the EV market to see if it works for you wit current cars available. A PCP would avoid you loosing loads on depreciation when the new 200 mile models come out in the next few years; late this year for the leaf. In 2 years time you could buy the PCP leaf outright quite cheaply and it wont have cost much more than using cash now or walk away if resale values have tanked due to 200 mile range cars. You could use it as a deposit for a 2018 40kWh+ leaf if there is any equity which is unlikly. A Nissan dealer may play ball and give you something if they want to reach a sales target.  
 
I too was very much a buy cash sort of person but the PCP rates on EV's are comparable with fuel saving costs so it is as close to a free car as you will get. ie. 5k pa in a 35mpg ice will cost you about £65 per month + £12.50 + tax so close to £80pcm in running costs (no depreciation). £130 + (£15 per month electricity) gets you a leaf and running costs and a known depreciation. You will not find any car that is a 64-15 plate that will depreciate less than £65 per month.

"Hi Jan, 
Not sure of your time scales. But the Milton Keynes Electric Vehicle Experience Center (EVEC) is due to open this month on the 22 nd. It is impartial and will be set up using government funding to allow people to find out about EV's from a number of car makers. Cheap rental for trying out cars is also available. If you are reasonably local could be very informative. At the moment things are changing all the time that is why I ended up with a two year deal on the I3 REX 94AH. The range extender is the best thing since EV's really makes driving an ""EV"" a pleasure with the current state of public chargers. I have 18 months before I have to make a decision but it will not be a fossil fuel car.

"Last year I emailed the council pointing out that HGV's were ignoring the restrictions and taking the relief roads and just continuing to take the direct route through Bicester contributing to the congestion and pollution, the response was that there was nothing they could do   why bother putting restrictions in place if your not going to enforce them. 
 
Another barmy idea was to introduce traffic calming measures by blocking one side of the road and forcing them to drive head on into the path of incoming traffic   this is as barmy as it gets, so now at bust times there are long queues of traffic waiting to drive down a road where the only restriction is a traffic island placed there at great expense by the council, all these cars are sitting there with their engines running and when they pull away they add even more to the pollution, after waiting for an inordinate length of time while the traffic continues to stream towards them they spot a gap and are forced to take their live into their hands and dive into the path of the oncoming traffic to get round the obstruction, it is the cause of lots of road rage incidents, I have been on the end of a few myself despite doing nothing wrong, you really couldn't make this up. 
 
The latest masterpiece of joined up thinking is to close the through route off altogether, yep that will work a treat, people driving even further to get to where they want to be will really help reduce the congestion and emissions. 
 
There is also another traffic calming measure at the bottom of the Churchill road, they have put a traffic island in the middle of the road so one side is narrow to stop wide vehicles getting through, the trouble is when they narrowed the gap on one side they made the gap on the other side wider, any prizes for guessing what the trucks do (and before anyone says anything I am aware that they can't block the road completely because emergency services have to be able to get through} but if they aren't going to enforce it why bother in the first place.",2016,11,30

Anyhow ... Now it is all clear 
 
Thanks 
 
PS: PHEV grow faster and are much bigger in size then BEV ... I think that more then the technology, the limitation is due to what market can offer ... possibly the PHEV success is mainly driven by few ""popular"" models ... BEV for mass market , may there is still not an ""ideal"" product in the market , or looking at Jan 2017 .. maybe it is just arrived and / or popular PHEV models are getting old 
 
PPS: I believe BEV is going to be a 2nd car for many years to come .. and a 2nd car, normally should cost under or around 10k as new .. and at the moment the cheaper is around 50% more expensive then this level. Anyhow ... will be interesting to see how much progress can make ZOE in 2017, which apparently is the BEV of this year. (If Fiat would offer the 500e in UK, I'm sure it will be sold like crazy)  
 
PPPS: Battery cost is the main handicap for PHEV and BEV .. at the moment it penalize more the BEV ... for instance Outlander PHEV now (since a while actually) cost like a Diesel version .. so at least one producer managed to make the magic to offer the PHEV at same price of a standard car.",2017,2,7

"@Marli  Personally I think it's daft to think this lull in EVs is because people are waiting for Model 3.  
 
The fastest growing sector is fleet sales. These guys' bread and butter is low lease cost and low BIK rates. Fleet buyers aren't in the queues waiting for pre-orders. They want their cars yesterday. 
 
In the next year or so the only way to do that is discounted low CO2 diesels, augmented with a further push on newer PHEVs. 
 
Not that it's a bad thing, PHEV growth = increased battery demand = better supply chains = more pure EV range (hopefully into pure EV only range)",2017,3,6
"@John Riley  I wonder if it's to do with the upcoming BIK changes. If the list price of a hybrid is much lower than the list price of an equivalent PHEV, then the latter becomes less attractive. 
 
We could also be seeing significant off loading of ""old stock"" hybrids, as the manufacturers look to run them out before they bring in PHEVs. For fleet cars this can make huge differences to the effective monthly rentals. 
 
Personally I get a distinct feeling that business optimism in 2016 was at it's highest I've seen for a long time, and many businesses were going into growth mode, employing more people and giving out more cars, as well as refreshing older cars that had been held longer waiting for growth. Both could have caused a cyclical bump in car sales across the board.  
 
One other factor is this optimism lead to small business owners, probably the ideal target for PHEVs rather than larger company fleets, already having renewed last year.

"Noticed in the last week or so that a lot of companies have announced new EVs due this year. Wondered which (if any) people on here were the most excited about? 
 
Personally, for me I am looking forward to the EQA Merc as I'm hoping it could be one I go for and I also love the look of the Cupra El Born, looks very similar to the ID3 but I slightly prefer the styling on the El Born.  
 
The Enyaq looks interesting too and also pretty interested in the ID4. Sure there are more I have forgotten about too.",2021,1,25
"Excited about: 
Mustang Mach E - Ignoring debates over whether it's a ""true mustang"", it's a bit more interestingly styled than most CUVs and the reviews are generally very positive. Looks like a genuine Model Y competitor. Seems to be exciting and playful to drive (and thankfully the lack of a second gear should keep it out of ditches unlike other mustangs), with range, space, decent pricing.  
 
EQA - yet another blobby small/medium CUV. However, the big excitement for me about it is what it will do to that segment of the market. Volvo will struggle to justify £10k+ extra for the XC40, and given an EQA or a kona for the same price the EQA must surely be a strong contender? I think the Kona is a great car, but if the EQA is the car that pushes Hyundai to lop £5k off the price of it then even better! I like what this will do to the market. Also see below about the UX300e... 
 
Fiat 500 - cheeky EV convertible. Expansion of EVs into new market areas is great, and injecting that bit of fun, joie de vivre, etc into the market is even better.  
 
MG E-motion - again, expanding EVs into wider market areas. A good looking 2-door coupe in the C-class/E-class coupe kind of size area, ~60kWh battery and if they can land it under £30k then another market-expanding option (plus a coupe with an MG badge is a bit more on-brand for MG). No idea if it's FWD or RWD, hoping the latter.  
 
 
Not excited about: 
Rivian R1S/R1T - Nothing against them. I think they are really nicely engineered and will do a lot of shift parts of the market that might be more thoroughly ICE-entrenched. However, we're now more than 2 years past the ""Launch"" event and they're still not on sale. 2 years ago a $100k+ EV pickup seemed viable at the luxury/adventure market end of things, but the ""competition"" mantra applies. Now you've got Atlis XT, Lordstown Endurance and of course the Tesla Cybertruck coming to face the R1T head-on, all with much lower starting prices than the R1T. A real shame, but I feel like the boat is leaving and Rivian are frantically driving on the dock hoping to leap onto it as it departs. I suspect Rivian will get R1Ts out before Lordstown or Atlis, but is the price low enough? Will it be a halo car while Rivian make their money in vans and Lincolns?  
 
Mazda MX30 - in principle I have no problem with the MX30. I get Mazda's angle on ""smaller battery, better value"" (having owned a Leaf 24), and it seems to be a broadly accomplished vehicle. No, there's one stupid little thing that totally destroys the MX30 for me - it's Mazda's dunderheaded refusal to even try to move away from ICEness, manifested in two specific ways in the MX30. The first is that they deliberately blunted its performance so as not to show up their ICE offerings too badly. The second is the ""I can't believe it's not an ICE"" noise - not an external pedestrian noise but an internal noise in the cabin. That kind of thing is fine in my opinion if you want it (and Porsche and Jag offer such), but there's a very key difference - in the mazda it can not be disabled! Nope. 
 
Lexus UX300e - Seriously, 50kW Chademo in 2021? Not to mention EQA/Model 3SR+ money for a very small, very cramped little dressed up toyota CHR? The cynic in me wants to suggest it's a ""false flag"" operation to try to prove that ""self charging"" UX250h are better and sell more of those (and I say that as owner of a GS450h).

"It will be interesting to see where the PSA Vauxhall join goes. We already have the issues of Citroen Dealers not being willing to Touch Peugeots and vice versa. In Colchester we have Peugeot and Vauxhall owned by the same dealers, so one or other will go Im sure, and the Citroen Dealership is a fairly small company with a loyal following. 
 
With Europe GM now cast adrift from GM, I cant see it lasting long, the vehicles were part of a world market and were developed to be used all over the world in different ways. They will now over time become PSA based vehicles, and lose the GM world advantages. It made sense for GM as Europe has not been as productive in income terms as would have been expected. The sale was inevitable, and it was previously to have been a tie up with Fiat, who eventually pulled out, leaving just the use of some of their engines in GM vehicles. PSA and Fiat already collaborate in many vehicle platforms and engines. Butt then Ford did work with Fiat as the KA was on the Fiat 500 platform. 
I doubt very much if long term PSA will continue any vehicle manufacture in the UK apart from Vans which has already been announced. Brexit will be the final death toll for investment. 
I think Vauxhall was something that PSA had to live with to take Opel out of the European competition market. I would live to see what the deal was. I doubt that a lot of cash was involved, but a lot of debt was. 
I recently purchased some Kit from the Netherlands, and the commercial transfer of funds was around 10% from being parity with the Euro. 
Costs of imported parts (a large proportion of a car) are now getting expensive so manufacturing will be more cost effective abroad, and save the costs of importation of the components from European suppliers. The final product just being one importation and no high UK labour costs. 
A lot of EU cars are now built in the East of Europe where costs are lower. That will im sure expand. So some good will come out of Brexit for those countries. 
Going back a few years, VW bought SEAT to have ""third world manufacturing costs"" in europe. It worked for some years, not sure thats still the case, but Im sure SEAT cars cost less to build than a VW in Germany.",2018,4,27
"Ever since the Tesla 3 pre-order craziness I remember distinctly reading some quotes from a big auto-maker about there been no demand for EVs. I tried searching for BMW, Audi, Jag etc, all coming out blank, and than came across this piece. I cannot find the original interview but I know the Infiniti has cancelled their luxury EVs many times....It seems like Carlos better whip the others under the Renault-Nissan group to get on message about EVs  . 
 
Such a shame, because we know Nissan has a 60kWh pack that can fit in a Leaf, we know the Infiniti brand can sell cars at the £40-50-60K bracket Nissan just cannot do, and we know the Infiniti EV had been in development since 2013, which would have meant it would now be just about ready for production  .

"It's quite a conundrum - there seems no logic in pitching super-economic cars (as EVs are) towards high/ middle income car owners. Logically EVs fit at the lower end of the market, where the low maintence/ low running costs are a perfect fit, for those on constrained incomes! 
 
Musk was smart to target the luxury sector - but there in no evidence that volumes in luxury sector make for a profitable business. So the Inifinity boss is probably not wrong. He is being 'Mr Sensible Shoes' and marketing cars on traditional virtues!  
 
However, the EV revolution only has validity as mass market products - where sales volumes can demonstrably reduce fossil fuel consumption and there can be a measurable improvement in urban area air quality. 
 
The Tesla 'eruption' is interesting to watch - but in economic and environmental terms the sales are not significant.  
 
Sadly Leaf /Zoe / other BeVs are flat-lining. The people whose lifestyle would be enhanced by the economics are unwilling (in adequate numbers) to embrace the technology risks (none?) and the constraints of range limited transportation! 
 
It's interesting to conject if we are yet at the proverbial 'tipping point' - it's my view that the Tesla-3 bids are giving a false indication of popular uptake of zero carbon transport. The reality is that it's nothing more than a ripple. BEV sales are not going to change dramatically - without legislative action (e.g. Scrapping polluting diesels). That seems an impossibility given UK politics!",2016,4,9
"BEV sales have always been assumed to be driven on fuel costs and the price of petrol. This is no longer the case as EV sales are now disconnected from the price of oil. High wage earners buy Model S's for performance and driving experience, not to save money on fuel. This message is now out in the mainstream and coupled with wider public concern over pollution and CO2 you have reasons to buy EV's that have nothing to do with how much a litre of diesel is at the pumps.",2016,4,9
"Premium cars are bought to at least a certain extent for snob value/pose value/presence/image/prestige/whatever you want to call it. 
 
So a new technology that no-one else has (Electric Drive) is a perfect fit for a market where being able to boast about your car is just as important as what it actually does.  
 
After all, an Aston Martin is actually a pretty rubbish sports car and has fairly lousy luggage space. But I'd still buy one in a heartbeat ...",2016,4,9
"This input from  @GreyDad  supports the assessment that Tesla uptake is rather 'soft' and has little basis in the tradition mores of car selection. Psychologists will write books about the attributes of conventional cars and whether they result in failure, or success e.g. Prestige Brand, body style, handling, engine type/size, leather and gadgets. Deciding whether a Merc (it Jag) will succeed is not rocket science - that's how these companies have prospered with multi-model, multi-market ranges if cars. 
 
GreyDad is saying that Tesla's success in not down to being electric - not being economical. He is suggesting something more ethereal - like performance and driving experience.  
 
I'm in not say saying that the Model-S is not an impressive package - but if the brand is being selected for subjective values - then brand loyalty may be weak. If Merc bring out a better Autopilot, or BMW produce superior handling - then these current Tesla owners may be open to switching brands. 
 
Of course I (and most on SpeakEV) want BEVs to 'rock the market' and create a motoring revolution. However, wishing /wanting doesn't cut it in the marketplace. Fleet Managers are hard headed businessmen who procure the majority of cars in the UK market using objective criteria. I'm very much doubting that the Tesla S and E are encroaching to any significant degree on fleet sales. Tesla S sales are understood to have peaked in the U.S. and there are no foreseen replacement for the S. In my view the road ahead for Tesla is bumpy - S sales are likely to decline before Model 3 sales get to credible levels. As for the Model X - it's a 'lemon', I'm afraid!",2016,4,9
"Brand, image and personal identity has a huge part to play in all this. Tesla have created a ""clean"" brand (in more ways than one) which makes the fakery of Infiniti all the more transparent by comparison.

"Tesla also have an advantage in being just Tesla. Few people are aware they built stuff for Mercedes.

But a Tesla is a Tesla. So you have an interesting inversion. Toyota created Lexus because they couldn't get Mercedes buyers into a Toyota. Whereas a Model 3 owner (ahem) feels as much a part of the Tesla ""club"" as a Model X driver.

"The beauty of the Curtis / HPEVS is the degree of adjustments that can be made (With the proper kit and software or hand held kit) even down to how your throtle pedal reacts. ie, lots of reaction when you first push the pedal and not a lot at the end of the travel, a steady rise through the pedal travel, or little to start and lots to finish, or any thing between this range. The level of regen can be tailored to suit, some dont like a lot and many like shed loads, thats all possible (But too much regen on a high voltage for the controller pack, and you can drive the controller into over voltage. ) 
And to ensure that a customer cant do 65 in reverse, you can limit revs in reverse.  
One feature that is useful, is that you can limit power delivered, at different % at a number of points through the rev range. On the Electric C1s, the original builders were looking for higher range so deliberately reduced the power available at higher RPM so although you could do 65 with a fair wind , its not easy to achieve on the flat without a long run up. But if the power had been made available then the power draw would seriously have reduced the range. Or you could compensate for a reducing torque delivery as the revs rise by reducing the power at lower RPM and increasing at higher. Result would be a flatter torque delivered experience. But thats not something I would see as being of any value. 
The issue of bigger vehicles (jag mk2) is a challenge. For those who follow EVTV, thats why the siemens ex transit connect was such a good proposition. But at the much higher voltage than the Curtis controllers can work at. The cost of two or more motors and controllers is not trivial (Good word Jack).  
I get a lot of customers who think that just winding up the power will deliver greater performance. Yes if you have a battery pack that can deliver high constant discharge rates, and actually quite large cables to deliver it. Needless to say most people dont want to buy enough pack AH, and want to reuse some old bit of kit that might just work.  
A conversion isnt cheap, even for a small car, why spend £10 to £20k on a conversion of a £500 fiesta. Because at the end you have an electric £500 fiesta. And few people would really have your vision, but add a few £k to the basic car, (911 anyone) and you have a delightful conversion.",2017,5,17
"As I see it the problem with EVing a classic vehicle is that the likelihood of finding a vehicle with a dud engine and good bodywork at the same time is low. Classic cars have either been totally cherished for their whole life and are thus expensive to buy or they have suffered a number of years of neglect and everything is in need of expensive TLC. Then there are the cosmetic restorations which are to be avoided as they are money pits.  
 
Splitting good bodywork and a good engine will drop the value like a stone. Only if the badge is one that collectors would fight for like a 911 would doing an EV conversion offer any hope of getting ones money back. You really need a model that is going to become a wanted classic soon but that means moving to later cars that will often have more complex electronics.  
 
No matter - I continue to consider a Citroen CX conversion as the ride is outstanding, high speed cornering is good and the car remains very stable above 100 mph with a Cd of 0.28 and a low CofG. I used to have a fuel injected manual 2400 Series 1 GTi with 120 bhp with the iconic drum speedo and rev counter. Massive stopping power with power brakes. It is not too electronically complex, the engines were never great, old fashioned even being massive heavy push rod driven 2.4 / 2.5 lumps with modest power output for the capacity.  
 
The CX is build on a chassis. Yes really it is - even in the 1970s and early 19080s. It does make for good performance in respect of NVH (Noise Vibration Harshness). But they rot badly since the steel is not of great quality and protection was limited.  
 
In respect of how many bhp and newton m you put in with a battery and motor, along the way trading performance with range or filling the car with battery for both; since the older cars had more modest bhp and newton m than current it should not be too difficult to recreate the original experience. But without the wallet sapping less than 20 mpg fuel consumption which rendered the cars obsolete. Weight is an issue as the cars were heavy but hopefully most of that is the engine block which is lorry sized.  
 
The dream is an EV CX that would out gun anything, apart from a Citroen C6, in ride and comfort and glide like a classic RR. All out grunt and shove is not so important but range would be as the car has to be a cross country cruiser.",2017,5,17
"All great points Mr_G! 
I have a lot of offers to buy the 911 since the James Cooke Video, through Richard. 
As you know i paid approx £20,000 after selling the engine and petrol tank, and those were the best parts of the car!!  
Had it been in mint condition it would have cost £60,000/£80,000. 
So it id swings and roundabouts really!  
if I did not have the money for the 911 I would have gone for a VW Beetle, because you can pick up a 'good' one for £10,000 or so, and they are ideal for a conversion, and Richard has done a few before!!  
It is not a 'Beetle' anymore with its good range and sports car performance. 
The Silver one, that Richard has just done, looks great before turning a wheel.",2017,5,17
"@henryv  A car story of when you put together something very special.  
 
Years ago my uncle found a Bentley Straight 8 Chassis without engine in a bog in Ireland. He bought it. After detailed research tracking down engines he found a 1929 race prepared unused Straight 8 engine back from Le Mans in a crate at Southampton Docks that not been collected for more than forty years after the company crashed in the same year. The crate had survived the Blitz and WWII. He bought the crate and put chassis and engine together in a perfectionist restoration. There are just 13 of these cars in the world. Later a Dutch collector asked to see the car and afterwards put his cheque book on the farmhouse kitchen table while they had a cup of tea, signed and dated a cheque and said 'Just fill in the amount, I want the car'. My uncle did not sell the car at that point in time.",2017,5,17
"I know it's been done with 944s before, but a 924 would work really well. There's loads of space in the engine bay, around the transaxle (and down the centre of the car if you do away with the torque tube) for batteries and you could still get decent weight distribution. Plus a good condition 2 litre car can be found for 2 or 3 grand.

"Im in discussions with a customer for converting 1961 mercedes coupe. Its had a lot of rebuilding carried out and is now in beautiful silver. It would make a really nice conversion and isnt actually as heavy as I had feared. Hopefully we can do this, it will be so much fun.  
Personally I am on the lookout for a reasonable fiat 500 (60s/70s) some Ive looked at are just so rotten that I dont have the time to do the body repairs. Somewhat shocking was that one of them was only just out of its Italian MOT equivalent, and it was awful. Heaven knows how it got a ticket the year before.  
As a simple package of parts I have sold two citroen C1s to be stripped by the proud new owners to given them all the bits they need for conversions.

"The people talking about Bonnet going bust are comedians. 
 
Bonnet still makes sense for a lot of people and in time, when energy prices eventually normalise, I like to think there will be a return to the packages we know and love. 
 
I've always said it, Bonnet is in many ways a dormant company in the building phase. It doesn't need to make money right now. 
 
The focus right now is on building its user base so it finds its way into the hands of every EV driver. A time will come when the majority of ev drivers are reliant on the public charging network and that is when bonnet will come into its own. 
 
The current approach still makes sense for the end user, it allows bonnet to weather the current storm and stop hemorrhaging cash. It can then emerge from its crysalis when the energy price crisis is resolved. 
 
Reports of Bonnets demise are greatly exaggerated much to the haters chagrin.",2022,11,4
Good point. Done.,2022,11,6
"Bonnet seems to be having some issues. Rocked up to an Osprey in Cardiff this morning. Bonnet said it was out of service and wouldn't even let me try to start a charge. So I used my contactless card and it worked just fine. 
 
Then at Beaconsfield Ionity this afternoon. Total bedlam with many waiting, Mr 100% in his Fiat 500, Mr Mercedes trying to jump the queue etc. Eventually get onto a charger. According to Bonnet it's already occupied. Bonnet also thought the one of the other chargers that was in use was available. Hmmm. 
Used my Electric Universe card, checked Bonnet again as I was walking away and it was not saying the charger I was using was available! 
 
Not much point paying £2 a month for 10% discount if you can't actually start a charge! 
First time I've had issues with Bonnet.",2022,12,16

"Hi just a quick heads up to anyone still using Bonnet that taking photo's for rewards seems to be a bit of a con based upon my experience this week. 
 
I am still using the app and we were in Norfolk at the weekend and I saw the site we were using had no photo's so I thought I would add a few, took them on the phone and when we got to the rental property I tried to upload them. Alas I was not aware that the App no longer allows you to upload photos and you have to take them within the app and upload at the site. 
 
So I went back to the site the following day and took another set of photos within the app and they were uploaded saying they would be reviewed. 
 
So nearly a week on and no photos uploaded and I got in touch with Bonnet to see how long the process takes, and was told that the photos were rejected and deleted. 
 
No reason why they were rejected and no ability of Bonnet to explain why. 
 
So be aware that if you want to help other users with a photo it might just get rejected and deleted and your time wasted with no feedback... 
 
Also make sure you use the app to take photos and hope the mobile signal is strong enough. 
 
The reward is not fantastic but I do like to help folk find the chargers and a photo really helps but Bonnet is taking a step backwards and helping their downward trend... 
 
I have raised a complaint so will see if I can get a better explanation...",2023,2,3
I had the same issue a few weeks back I took a picture to unload at a later date but looks like you have to upload picture on the app while at the site.,2023,2,3
"Bonnet told me I had violated their Terms and Conditions, so they “adjusted” my legacy credit. 
 
Now they tell me that I hadn’t violated their Terms and Conditions at all, but they haven‘t reversed the “adjustment”, and offered me a very small credit as a gesture of goodwill - I have not accepted it.",2023,2,5
"At some point most reasonable people realise they’re flogging a dead horse and walk away. Yes, you signed up a lot of new users for Bonnet and you accumulated a lot of charging credit but you never actually used it and basically they’ve politely said your time has run out, your credit has gone. 
 
I probably signed up about 1/3rd the number of new users you did, but I used up my free credit as I got it and I bought the 200kW package every month as well. At the end, I had no credit left and the price was unattractive so I moved on to Elli, which has very similar terms to old Bonnet. The result? I got cheap charging for 9 months and you got?",2023,2,5
"I thought the USP of Bonnet, when Robert Llewellyn gushed so fulsomely a year or more ago, was that they ""simplified"" the business of using public charging... it doesn't look like they do to this bystander!",2023,2,5
"I think they did. You could roll up to most car chargers and get a discounted charge rate by using their app. But then the discount got smaller and eventually basically disappeared and if you compare their offer to Elli, it's quite poor value.",2023,2,5

",2023,2,6
"I don't see why they want the photos to show nothing other than the charger? Surely the point of the photos is to help you find the charger, given they are sometimes tucked away at the corner of a P&R site (Ipswich), at the far end of a car park behind a supermarket (Caerphilly Morrisons) etc. Just a close up of the charger itself doesn't help you locate it!",2023,2,6
"Yes, it’s a pity. Clearly whatever their business model was, the Ukraine war and high gas/electricity prices kyboshed it and now they’re not playing nice with you guys. 
 
On the upside, it was pretty good value while it lasted.",2023,2,13
"Funny, about a year ago, I never thought I'd use our PowerPass/Elli once it ran out (last Nov), convinced Bonnet was the way forward. Now Elli are lightyears ahead of Bonnet in terms of cost and really opens your eyes to what's important in the app, which isn't actually the app at all its the cost of charging. Bonnet had the tech but unable to bankroll it any longer. Will see how long Elli can do it (we've already seen increase in prices in Europe announced). You have to think at some point this is all going to go the way of fuel pumps and just be contactless and you go to whoever the cheapest is. Any value they try to add with other features are largely superfluous.",2023,2,13
"For the sake of  roaming  aggregated billing and other conveniences, such as an RFID card or Plug&Charge I would be prepared to pay a small (and I mean small!) service fee on top of the going rate at any network. 
 
In the long run we have to hope/expect that price competition will become like it has for petrol. Bonnet-type schemes only served to obfuscate prices. They create winners and losers. If a company charges a significant membership fee but then offers good discounts it possibly benefits the high-consuming user, but it's a gamble and every now and again they know they win-back when you go on holiday. Meanwhile low users pay over the odds. 
 
It's a crappy system. Better to get a good market-competitive tariff at ""the pump"" and let people decide if they want a bit of extra ""service"" for which they pay a small overhead fee, either per transaction, monthly or annually.",2023,2,14

"Hmmm I am not sure winning £500 credit will be of any use if they cease to trade.... Perhaps time to start winding down credit ASAP... 
 
I was fully behind them at the start but they did not have a sustainable business model and they don't even say what this next round of funding is for...",2023,2,27
"I really didn't understand what their business model was. They were literally giving away money at the outset, providing charging for way less than what it cost them to purchase from the CPOs. It was said by some that the model was based on building a huge base of users to presumably gain from the data somehow, but I could never fathom how the data would have been valuable to the extent that they actually made money considering the rate at which they were chucking the notes out of the window. Surely, everyone has the right anyway on GDPR principles to object to their data being used in that way? 
 
If anyone could explain how the business model was supposed to work, that would be useful, because I just don't see it, and it clearly is not coming to pass. The general principle in life is that you don't get owt for nowt and their largesse was always going to be too good to last for long.  
 
This crowd funding initiative is likely to raise peanuts because anyone with a brain is not going to go near it with a bargepole. Therefore, they are going to run out of money very soon. I am going to have a stab at Easter being the date of death.",2023,2,27
"Yup had it too, writing is on the wall I suspect. Will be using our credit next time we're out and about charging to burn it down. Usually use Ionity and get better rates via PowerPass but better to use the £100 I have saved up in Bonnet at the 70p or whatever than lose it.  
 
The reason they are trying to build a big user base is so they can go to CPO's and say 'hey we've got X thousand/million users, sign us up with preferential rates and we can direct our users to your chargers'. The problem is, chargers are all stupid busy at the moment, so CPOs have no interest. Hence Bonnet presumably subsidised the rates for a while and now have fallen back on the token 10% that CPOs are willing to offer anyone.",2023,2,27
"I'm guessing they thought they could play one CPO against another. Going to InstaVolt and saying 'we've got X million members and Osprey onboard and they've given us a rate of say 50p/kWh rather than 80p/kWh, what you gonna do, sit on it and lose customers to Osprey?' But I think generally the CPO's new there is enough demand out there, and probably Bonnets numbers were not sufficiently high enough to get any leverage. The other thing they can play is the 'we're the one stop shop for charging' and if you're not on the app then no one will use you. But again CPOs can see they're mega busy and dont give a crap! Basically the USP evaporated.",2023,2,27

"I popped into Cherwell Valley Services earlier and there were 6 or 7 EVs either charging or waiting to charge so looking at this Gridserve would need to add at least another 2 Rapid chargers just to keep up with the requirements now. As EV ownership is growing expotentially it isn't hard to do some simple maths and work out that Gridserve haven't a hope in hell of installing enough chargers to satisfy the growth, even if you take the Welcome Break MSAs out of the equation there is just no way they will be able to keep up on their own. People are already having to queue at Rugby and Instavolt is expanding their Banbury hub due to demand. 
I just can't see Gridserve being able to raise enough investment capital to be able to install enough chargers to come even close to satisfying the existing or future demand.",2021,12,5
"Other networks are available but queues at chargers will be longer next spring when all the pre ordered EVs are delivered.

Tesla will see an opportunity to open up the Superchargers to all next year perhaps?,2021,12,5
Those are near capacity too,2021,12,5
"I think a challenge was set a while ago on the forum for someone to have a stab at working out just how many chargers of various types are required and where they'll need to be for EV journeys to be stress free over the next couple of years. 
 
You'd think that the Government would have done that exercise before announcing funding, else how would they know what funding was needed and where it should be allocated. Anyone seen anything from them, it doesn't need to be secret? 
 
I gave it some brief thought and concluded there were too many variables with uncertain boundary conditions to do it justice. For example: 
 
How many EVs are there now and how is that changing? 
 
How big is the average battery and how efficient are EVs (and are averages misleading)? How quickly is it changing? Is that towards bigger batteries (more range) or towards more & cheaper EVs (but with smaller batteries).  
 
How does the efficiency of the charging networks interact with the specification of EVs? (Eg Tesla SR+ at around 180 mile motorway range is an workable option due to the Superchargers) 
 
What journeys do people make and with what dimensions (time, distance, urgency, planned/unplanned etc). Do motorways or A roads dominate? Are there obvious hot spots? 
 
How flexible is the average EV driver re upper and lower charge levels (always leave with 100%, charge at no less than 20%, arrive with no less than 30% etc) 
 
How do peak times affect the requirements? Eg lunch time on Bank Holidays on motorways 
 
How price sensitive are EV drivers? Would aggressive surge pricing spread demand?  
Eg lunch time on Bank Holidays on motorways 
 
How reliable can you assume the charging network to be? 
 
What charging speeds can you assume the networks to provide? 
 
How do you manage/ optimise queuing? 
 
Once you generate your algorithm, which of the inputs has the largest sensitivities? Eg if average range was 20% higher do most of the issues go away? 
 
Phew, no wonder I opened another bottle...",2021,12,5
"Those that are free, are often not working, and I'm not sure if companies are overstretched or just don't care. 
 
Had a trip yesterday to Brighton and back from London, NCP car park all 3 Polar 7kW chargers failed to charge, so went to nearby Shoreham, Osprey failed to start CCS charge after several attempts. Nearby Shell being AC charged by Fiat 500, CCS reported as faulty on Zap Map. Had to AC charge on the Osprey to get me to Cobham where I managed to get my first rapid charge on Ionity. When I got home I started to wonder whether my car had a charging fault so visited local Shell rapid, iPace ahead of me failed to get a charge and when at my suggestion he called Shell helpline was told charger was faulty and Shell were made aware several days before. 
 
In all my time owning EVs (around 7 years) I've never experienced so many faulty chargers in a day.",2021,12,5
"There is no way that Gridserve will be able to install enough chargers to support the number of EVs that will be hitting the road next year, they seem to beleive that hubs are the way forward that isn't going to work for motorway travel, EcoT's dogged determination to maintain their exclusivity deal with MSAs has already put EV take up by years and has been a major contributory factor in EV range anxiety. 
MSAs are going to need 50+ chargers in the next few years the government needs to open them up to competition its the only way they will get enough chargers into MSAs. 
Ay the end of 2021 its ridiculous that there are still MSAs that don't have CCS.",2021,12,5
"I'm pretty sure rugby is self distorting due to its status. 
How many rapids are withing 30 mile? 
I bet you carrot they are seeing almost zero uptick in use due(or even drop) to the fact nobody wants to take the risk in turning up and 1 charger means 100% outage. Or 1 car means doubling your charge time. 
 
12 chargers means the same ratio of cars should expect a 33 minute wait.(effectively a rounding error to turning up to an empty charger) 
And 1 charger outage means an extra 2 minutes wait time even if 12 cars were already there.",2021,12,6
"Like i said, SOMETIMES moving the car is viable, sometimes its not. If its a location where people are expected to park for 8 hours a day while at work, then introducing a 4 hour limit doesnt help anyone, BEV or PHEV, because the BEV driver cant then use it either. Or, even if you COULD move it, are you going to leave the office at say lunch time, potentially walk 5-10mins to the car park to move your car TO the charger, to find that someone else has jumped on before you, or the other guy simply hasnt moved? Its just a nonsense suggestion. 
 
Obviously we dont know anything about this location. But for instance i've seen folk moan about charger hogging at train stations and park/ride sites, which is clearly completely nuts.

The salesman quoted me a 3 yr battery rental contract which is £10 cheaper than 2 yr's, and I was told I can terminate after 2 years without penalty charge, but I not 100% about this, someone reports that RCI has changed T&C's for the early termination fee £800+.

How many times do people not want an EV because once a month they travel 150 miles to visit relatives or whatever? They may have a 10 mile commute and otherwise be ideal for EV ownership, but that one trip 12 times a year puts them off. A PHEV ticks all the boxes. 
 
And let's face it. With all the animosity and vitriol from a small minority on this forum aimed at EV/PHEV owners who may have inadvertantly misused a fast charge point, who the hell would want to stop and use one? If I knew my Mrs was going to get some of the abuse dished out on some of these threads for accidental misuse of a charge point, I'd suggest she never gets an EV.",2015,5,21
"Back on topic in a second if I may, 
 
First, there will always be two sides to the is PHev helping the uptake of EV debate and I find all posts on this of interest in trying to decide. Of course being a BEV owner may cloud judgement in this but the way I currently see it is this; 
 
If you have adequate home and and/or workplace charging the answer is Yes PHevs are good, its a no brainer. 
 
I often hear the argument all electric miles are ""good"". (Full stop) 
 
However I have not heard any caveat for a full perspective for the above statement to have a meaning so we also need to recognise that non electric miles are therefore by comparison and definition not so ""good"" and so the total goodness is related to things like size of battery v engine, vehicle weight and drag and usage profile otherwise a Hummer with a 1/4 mile electric range would also be ""good"". 
 
There is however a big question mark in my mind when it comes to infrastructure. 
The former transport minister repeatedly voiced her opinion regarding BEVs that rapid chargers were ""for emergency use only"" or words to that effect. It may have been her defense mechanism for widespread criticism of OLEV on rapid charging pricing and reliability. However, if this idea is hard baked in to government thinking regarding BEVs then what chance is there of them recognising a need for additional charging infrastructure for PHevs? 
 
I see no evidence of them doing this. 
It looks increasingly like they are very happy for PHevs to multiply in order to unhook themselves from both the need for extra charging infrastructure and the embarrassment their inability to produce any fit for purpose is causing them. Look at Souce London, posts first being covered up before being felled and replaced with French built units and all works held back until the first working week after the election! Just last night I discovered our only local public charger, Banbury railway station Podpoin Ref: PP-12623, shown as available on Podpoint live map and still is, switched off with a Nissan EVSE locked to it and for a week now according to security man! 
 
So if charging infrastructure is unfit for purpose already with no sign of that changing any time soon you have to ask what effect could the PHev deluge have on the government plan to ""Encourage the uptake of EVs""? There is ample recent evidence of BEV owners throwing the towel in and moving to PHev or REX and the reason given is almost always lack of sufficient reliable infrastructure. New members and non members coming to the forums can see the problems we face and I can't help thinking dumping vast numbers of PHevs on to an already unfit for purpose infrastructure has to have a downside on aspiration for aspirers to use a currently fashionable phrase heard especially often around every election I can remember. 
 
The trouble is, everyone can see all the new PHevs on the roads (and chargers) however the damage this may be causing especially to sales and development of pure BEVs is totally opaque as there is no transparency. 
 
Of course PHevs have a place but if that place is sat on E.H. chargers often w/o driver or polluting streets driving round on ICEs looking for a needle in haystack ICE free, cost free and working charger with the current state of infrastructure something has changed and not necessarily for the better.

OT, This article is worth reading  Ford winning in PHEV market share over Toyota and GM, but has lower ratio of electric miles driven | The Long Tail Pipe  
Extract [The question is – which is more important? More plug-in vehicles on the road? Or a higher ratio of electric miles driven?]",2015,5,21
"From a manufacturer perspective the reality would appear to be: 
 
BEVs scary niche expensive product, unknown future viability. 
PHEVs less scary less niche expensive product, more stable future viability. 
ICE mass market cheaper product, most stable future viability. 
 
Until relatively recently, I would have put the chances of manufacturers sticking batteries in their popular cars as slim to none, and producing a big-battery BEV at absolute zero. 
 
With the recent (still limited) success of some plugin-hybrids I would now say the chances of a proliferation of plugin cars is much higher (good) and that the the economies of scale that brings to battery and hybrid technology alone increases the chances of faster developments in price and technology of batteries. 
 
In addition, several plugin owners have reported they really like the electric motoring feeling. Most BEV owners say they never WANT to go back, so this will I have no doubt increase demand for bigger and better batteries, and more BEVs over time. 
 
For most a hybrid garage seems a no brainer if you want to carry out long journeys or there's not a BEV to suit your needs. But somehow an all-in-one solution is (by a VERY small minority) frowned upon as some sort of abomination. 
 
Our family currently has a LEAF, just a LEAF. There's two adults, two kids and we've been like this for a while. We've been on camping trips, we work in different locations at different times and it all works fine. However there are times where the BEV range is limited, it's a decision, a compromise we chose to make. We're not normal. 
 
So for families like us who maybe want to go electric for whatever reason the option could be two cars, or one plugin hybrid. 
 
For most of our travel 20, 30, 40 miles EV range would suffice. We'd change charging patterns (we're a bit lazy having a whopping 80 miles in the LEAF, sometimes it can last for DAYS without being plugged in), but having an engine so trips out of range became totally stress free... I can certainly see the appeal. 
 
 @Samsam  says he bought his Zoe to save money, nothing else. Yet seems deeply offended that PHEVs exist. No idea why, doesn't make sense to me. 
 
I bought my EV for a mixture of loving the way EVs drive (this was what sold me on EVs to begin with) and the fact they have great environmental benefits, not least to localised air pollution. The fact the numbers worked ""sealed the deal"", but I WANTED them to work. 
 
Yet I hold firm in my belief that plugin cars, electric miles, it's all good. It's exciting, it's interesting, it's moving towards a different kind of motoring future. It's fascinating. 
 
Whatever your motivation, we're so early in the game that if you're plugging in your plugin and making that transition, fair play to you, and the more the merrier. May it mean my choice to go BEV gets trickier in the future due to creaky infrastructure, maybe, but that's my choice and I have to deal with it as I see fit, just as everyone has to deal with theirs.",2015,5,21
"Very much agree.. More plugins in general will result in more destination charging too... And that combined with cost will make rapid charging equation different. But I am convinced it will be phev that moves the EV forward more than pure EV, at least for another car generation until ranges improve along with more rapid charging to enable longer journeys.  
 
On the cost issue, that was an enabler for me to get into EVs but now I'd probably pay slightly more to keep one as they are so darn good. To think only cost matters is blinkered. It's a factor. Of many",2015,5,21
"Also don't forget that PHEVs have all the components of a BEV too, so this helps drive economies of scale and benefits everyone.",2015,5,21
"@GBEV  I think you need to separate destination (slow) charging from en-route (rapid) charging, Yes the governments view was that until there is a suitable network, rapids should not be relied upon for daily use, and as such would mainly be for occasional/un-usual use for a BEV. 
 
I don't think this has ever been suggested for destination chargers where I'd expect to see both bev & phev charging. 
 
The question is should a phev plug in to a rapid if it's free whilst stopping for a break mid journey? IMO the answer is that it is not relying on the charger, it is not dependant on and has no risk of being let down by poor infrastructure. It full complies with the Government advice of don't rely on it and it does reduce national pollution output (an ev mile from a phev = an ev mile from a bev = an ev mile). Simply: if it has a plug it can use it. But crucially, and  equally to any other user , it has no right to rely upon, and hence complain, if there is inadequate facility ie charger is out of order or there is a queue already. 
 
Of course high prices will deter anyone, both for fuel duty or charging fees...",2015,5,21
"The uptake of phev will get people talking... Asking the places they visit for infrastructure... Asking government... Public opinion will be more positive around EVs and thus more likely to see gov. Funds being used. People will have a better understanding of what's needed. All very positive.  
 
This is exactly what's needed... A much stronger groundswell of opinion not a few martyrs doing long bev journeys. (which is exactly what I used to to! Lol)",2015,5,21
"We are seeing a hiatus in roll out because I think that government and private networks need to see a return on their investment - even if for the time being that is just the things getting used rather than actual turnover. So if your local chargers are being PHEV squatted then you should be thankful, as it means the network owners can justify to those holding the purse strings that it's worth putting more in down the line.",2015,5,21
"PHEV owners can't win. There seem to be two distinct strands to objections: 
 
1. PHEV owners are only in it for the BIK savings and never actually charge their cars. So they get the financial benefits without contributing to the environmental cause. 
 
2. PHEV owners insist upon charging their cars even where they have plenty of petrol to continue their journey. Because their chargers are slow they end up spending a disproportionate amount of time a minimal charge which they don't really need. The response of a car with a fast charger to one with a slow charger is much the same as that of a fast car driver (e.g. Porsche) stuck behind a slow car driver (e.g. Prius with a caravan) . 
 
In reality and as has been alluded to above, the environmental benefits of a PHEV are almost exclusively down to the way it is driven. A PHEV that is never charged is as bad as any other ICE with mediocre fuel consumption. A PHEV that is driven only within the capacity of its battery is effectively being used as a BEV, with exactly equivalent environmental benefits. However a PHEV with a lower EV range makes it more difficult to achieve the latter.",2015,5,21
Nice new Outlander just down the road from me and I haven't seen it charge yet. They could be waiting for their charge point to be installed or are only in it for the BIK after all if it is your company car and they pay for your petrol why would you put your electricity in. On the upside the next private owner will be plugging it in for the rest of it's useful life.,2015,5,21
"They could be waiting for an install, they could be charging at work, they could regularly use a public charger. We don't know, it'd be wrong to judge.",2015,5,21

"The rise of Hybrids / PHEV on larger vehicles, is related to the rise in many global markets requiring fleet average Co2 to get below 100g/km within the next few years. Procucing such vehicles ensures the makers can go on building the rest of the fleet. Its also why some cars are not on general sale, ie Chevy Spark EV is mostly only sold in California, as is the Fiat 500.  
From a niche owners point of view they are a great bridge into the unknown world of Electric Vehicles, and if you live in an urban world with no off street parking they enable you in ways a straight BEV cant. Such vehicles also have advantages over ICE in relation to business tax/ private use of the vehicles. 
But as a user , above all the rise of Personal Lease Plans (Or whatever you call them) means such vehicles become affordable to actually purchase in two or three years, having been fully serviced and maintained.",2015,5,22

"So, I don't have an ev... 
I have been following and looking..for some time.. 
I am an engineer and a bit of petrol head.. 
Why don't I have an EV?? 
Mainly to do with purchase cost and range.. anything ""affordable"" had dreadful range and anything with range was unaffordable.. 
Those gaps have closed, a lot.. especially in the last 12 months.. 
 
So far the only EV that could replace ALL my vehicle needs, would be the Rivian R1T... But that's gonna cost (prob well out of my price range) and looks like it's delayed again.. 
 
Because of my job I tend to have to do longer commutes.. typically 50-60 miles each way every day, (previously been 83 each way.. ) 
Anything approaching 2 hours and it's usually a hotel job, but after 20 years of hotels I am very fed up of not being ""at home"" so if it's doable in time, I commute... 
No.. it's not likely I can change career now, or ever be closer to work/home... It's the nature of the industry I am stuck in... 
So, as much as I would prefer to replace the ICE, the EV's that could come close were the higher end models.. 
 
My thought is to keep 2 of my current ICE vehicles for those purposes the EV will not accommodate and get an EV for the commutes/day to day... 
The EV could be ""purchased"" through the company so possible cost/tax benefits there. 
The EV would need to be comfy, have good performance and range, As I am not one to be fanny about at 56mph. 
Charging should be possible at most work sites, but not always.. Home charging currently not possible, but in the future should be.. 
 
Oh.. my current ICE just clocked 26k miles in 16 months.. 16k+ more than I expected or wanted to..  
 
So I guess 20k in EV and maybe then less than 5k total for both the ICE could be possible..",2022,1,27
"Welcome. There's already quite some threads going on about 'what is the best EV for me'. Thing is, it's impossible to answer, we can just give some tips. 
 
One word of caution: you say you want to keep the ICE and only use the EV for commuting. I would at least ask you to rethink that. Almost everybody who has got used to an EV refuses to go back to an ICE anymore. The serenity and comfort of the drive, together with the instant power will make you feel more reluctant to take the ICE. So even though you think the EV will be 'just' for commuting, you'll find you'll want to take it for longer trips as well. So my main suggestion would be to not go for an EV that will just about get you to work and back, but go for a model with adequate range, say 220 miles WLTP or better. Once you accept that a 500 mile trip means having to stop twice for a 30 minutes' charge then travelling in a EV suddenly becomes no issue anymore. 
 
There's a fair number of options below the 40k bracket that will easily do 120 miles on a charge. As you'll know, EVs go less far in winter, so some overhead in the WLTP ratings is to be taken into account. It depends also on what you're looking for in a car. A Tesla Model 3 is a completely different car from a Kia e-Niro but they are both very valid EVs. So maybe you can elaborate a bit.",2022,1,27
"Sounds like a BMW i3 120ah could work. Or an older i3 94ah rex (onboard 650cc motorcycle engine working as a generator (range extender). 170 bhp motor, 0-62 7.1"" or 8.1 for the heavier rex version. 
Good handling and equipment levels so more fun to drive than many EVs.",2022,1,27
What's your monthly budget for this new car?,2022,1,27
"Maybe I didn't word it so well.. The EV would have to do everything else.. not just the (current) 120 daily.. and it wasn't a direct ""what should I get""...

"Thanks Harry6.  
James and Kate (YouTube) seem to really rate the MG5.",2022,1,27
"So you are looking for a minimum of 160 miles range (the round trip from previous work) at the speed limit in all weathers. Realistically there are few EVs that can do that - they would need a claimed range of 250 miles to allow for poor weather, diversions and the speed (which will reduce efficiency to under 3miles/kWh and hence a battery of over 55kWh plus a reserve. At the cheaper end of the market will be the LR version of the MG5 and MG ZS that might just manage it, otherwise you are into the big batteried versions of the VAG ID.3/ID.4 clones and the Kona. At the top end LR Tesla M3 etc. will manage it but I suspect out of the range of what you are willing to pay. 
Frankly I'd wait another cycle of ownership before making the switch unless you can be sure of keeping the range requirement to 120 or less or are willing to compromise your driving speed or are willing to charge at both ends of the journey.",2022,1,27

Dead of winter in driving rain and 60 mph gusts maybe not. But 65mph in those conditions is not a great idea anyway.  
 
MG5 is perhaps the best range / price on sale now. There is also the Fiat 500 with the bigger battery and the soon to be here GWM Ora Cat.

"This thread is quite good fun, but reveals one of the things that annoy me about EVs and modern cars in particular - they cost too much to insure. This seems mainly because manufacturers design them for the wealthy, usually older, demographic who can afford all the gadgets, can afford the insurance and aren't affected by the higher insurance as much in any case. Small family hatchback EVs like the 208 don't need sub 8 second 0-60 times. To hit the net zero targets, at some point in the future everyone will need to give up their ICE habit and drive EVs, and there is more chance of a backlash if the swap involves an extra £1,000 on the insurance for a significant chunk of the population just to buy a basic EV like an e208. Similar problem to people who don't have driveways or are relying on a landlord for an EV charger, again disproportionatly affecting younger people. 
 
Err, slight rant, realise I am part of the wealthy older demographic offered cheap insurance.   
 
But the insurance problem might be mitigated with some EU regulation forcing manufacturers to provide low power/cheaper to buy/ cheaper to insure models as the price of doing business in their area (of course the UK is too small to do this on its own).

"I am 19 and have had my Renault Zoe 22kwh since I was 18. Used temporary insurance while I was learning which was incredibly cheap and managed to get insurance when I passed for only £1,800 without a black box (What's the point of having an EV if I get punished for using its instant torque). After over a year of ownership, the only downside for me has been range. I manage to survive with its lets be real 60 mile motorway range in Scotland as the charging network is decent, there is only the need for one app and pretty much anywhere I need to be isn't far away. The main reason I purchased a Zoe is because they were really cheap and I could charge for free in Glasgow and still can. I paid around 6k in great condition, 96% battery health, 50,000 miles. I would highly recommend a Renault Zoe Q90 which is the same as my car but with double the range. It may not have 50kw dc charging but it has 40kwh AC charging which no other car has and because of this all the 43kwh ac chargers are always free and you can take advantage of the many 22kwh ac chargers which most cars can't take advantage of so when ur in a pinch even though its not as fast as DC charging its 3 times faster than most dc charging cars.

In another thread someone commented a Niro ev is around £6k more than an equivalent spec Niro (not checked this myself). Until price parity is met, something needs to differentiate and the biggest win for evs is the effortless wafting around. Why would you pay £6k more for an eniro if it wasn’t better? I doubt a more powerful motor is making up much of the price difference.",2023,3,27
"That sums up the manufacturers dilemma. They are selling to the wealthy where these things are important. In 8 years time the EV might be only £1,000 more to buy than the ICE Niro, but cost £1000 more plus per year to insure for a new driver. The wealthy new buyer gets to decide what this new form of transport looks like. 
 
Maybe this is how it always has been and over time the market will mature hopefully.

"When we had a Zoe 22kw, I had the same idea about limiting the power for learner drivers. So, one day on a straight and empty road, I put on Eco Mode and went for a 0-60 time. Well, after over 25 seconds, I still had not reached 60 mph 🤣.

Is this the gadget that will make EVs affordable for younger/newer drivers?

"OP, A few thoughts on Ioniq 38. Range in winter in bad weather can be as much as 200 miles. My 1st ever trip in mine was the day after I'd bought it, 10C temps, at night + heating on, 2up, we did a 160 mile non-stop trip almost all duals/motorways. As I had no idea of the range, I sheltered behind HGVs for 80% of the trip. Did the 160 miles & still had 40 left in the GOM. GOM on these is v accurate, unlike some! These days I do the same winter trip at lorry + 3 mph sort of speeds, and arrive with 20 miles left in the GOM. In summer I'll travel at more like genuine 65 & arrive with 20 in hand. 
Drive super slowly, <45 mph, and I can get 7 miles/kWh from it = 265 mile range, but that's too slow for normal travel, though perhaps acceptable on the Isle of Wight for eg! 
 
Speed & acceleration? 0-60 is 9.7 secs, power 134 hp acc to  Hyundai IONIQ Electric  
so it's no road-rocket, which is probably a good thing for a newbie! That said, it can travel v nippily if needed, as can most EVs, simply because the acceleration's there instantly. Whether it looks like a taxi or not should be irrelevant at this stage of driving. Mine looks good in Fiery Red, but the front grille in silver just looks tacky, so I'm tempted to get that sprayed to match the rest of the car, would improve the looks 500%. 
 
Dunno if the Ioniq 28's cheaper on insurance, but that has a summer range around 160 miles, winter 120 acc to most reports. But if I drove it the way I did my 1st trip I'm sure I could get 160 miles in winter at 10C wet road, though it would be a rather slow journey! The 28's cheaper to service, as the battery is air-cooled while 38 is liquid, so needs expensive coolant swap every 4 years - perhaps £250 extra? Something like that. 
 
Battery in 28/38 is reckoned pretty bulletproof with v low degradation, so I wouldn't worry about one >30k miles on it. 
Some of the 2019 & 2020 built 38s (including mine!) have had a battery swap, so I now have a brand new battery at 27k miles! So some of the 38s on sale will be in the same position! Could be a v crafty buy! 
 
There's been a coolant problem in a lot of Niros & Ioniqs ecently, H have apparently sorted this, so assuming they  have , these are looking to be pretty good value cars. Far better range than any other ""cheapo"" 45 kWh EV around, their efficiency means they're the cheapest to topup per mile, with possible exception of tiny e-UP!

"Let me present mine. Called Renault NL to arrange for a test drive (it was my very first contact with anything Renault ever). Lady on the phone: Nice, I see you can do a test drive this afternoon at your local dealership. Arrived there. Young salesguy, slick talker (I am a 50+ year old guy), didn't come out of his seat. Heavily shortened version of the conversation: 
 
- ""I am here for the test drive I arranged this AM with Renault NL"" 
""What? Wow, you're a lucky man! I have them queued up and you just slipped through!"" 
 
Me thinking: ""I am lucky I am considering buy a car from you?"". I drive the car (was sold in a minute), hand it in. 
 
""And? What do you think?"" 
- ""I like it"" 
""Great. Have you thought about the costs & financing?"" 
- ""I have. I know about the rental, no financing, and the electricity is a laugh"" 
""OK, I am asking because if you really do the math, E-driving is not cheaper than ICE driving"" 
 
Me thinking: ""WTF? Where am I?"" 
 
- ""Ehm right. I think I'm fine with my milage, and I like the ECO and futuristic aspect, it's something that fits who I am"" 
""OK. How do you intent to charge?"" 
- ""Well, I was thinking you pay for a chargepoint at my house"" 
""HAHAHAHAHA, No, no no no HAHAHA, you're funny"" 
- ""I am? Oh OK. Say, what about my old car?"" 
""You know, if I were you, I'd sell it privately. There is not much I can do (pulls up a web page showing my type of car, of course a year and a half older and a lot more more miles on the clock than mine, and just a sale, no trade in, and thus a ridiculous low price."" 
- ""Thanks, I'll think about it"" 
 
It was a  total  WTF experience (pardon my words). I was baffled. 
 
I am used to ""vote with my feet"" as we call it. I think you'd call it vote with your wallet. Drove to another dealer 30 miles away the next day. Started the conversation with a well dressed, fair talking salesman with the words: you are going to try to sell a Zoe to me. I'm already sold on it, lets talk business. He explained that other than their ICE's, Renault NL's policy on Zoe's was ZERO rebates, period. Free floor mats was about the best he could do. It was an open and fair conversation. We did the deal. Apart from a waaaaay too late delivery (august slipped to November) it was all smooth. They compensated me by charging just half the rate for a rental (I has sold my car on the promise of a delivery date). Service has been outstanding, both from a customer service point of view as dealing with the mechanics. 
 
Bottom line: Dealer is EVERYTHING. 
 
ps: that guy called two weeks later inquiring if I was considering buying the car. Told him I was more than considering and explained why I felt I was not treated as a customer and that I didn't think he had earned ANY deal. Short conversation really.",2016,6,11
It's funny how in the brochure for the car it doesn't tell you that you can't charge if there is an electrical pylon anywhere nearby. It's funny also that other electric cars do not have appear to have an electric pylon phobia. I think Renault really need to get to the bottom of this.,2016,6,11

Thanks everyone. I'm not going anywhere though - I still have a Leaf and I don't want a refund / PCP cancellation of my current Zoe - I want a replacement. I like the Zoe. I prefer driving it to the Leaf. It's lighter and the range is better. I just need one that isn't faulty!,2016,6,28
"For what it is worth (probably not much: different country, different dealer, different culture, sample size of one); my experience though formally you are in a transaction with a dealer, it's so often that they let you down when things turn south. The (few) dealings I have had with Renault itself, read the Dutch representation, is that as long as you deal with them in a professional way and not having a ""demanding"" attitude and/or a piss over every tiny detail, they are extremely helpful and prepared to go the extra mile. There are forum members here that would almost certainly disagree with a passion. 
 
But let me just give an example: A Dutch forum member decided to drive all the way up to Geiranger Norway (2000+ miles) to join a huge EV event. He missed a crucial charger for his trip in rural Norway and unfortunately the road had a barrier in the middle and there was no way he could make a U turn for (from memory) 10 miles or more. Long story short, he found himself stranded, called Renault in the Netherlands, saying he got battery-empty stranded. ""Where are you now sir?"". ""In Norway"". ""Erm..... Norway you say? Erm, you know what, we'll call you back in a few"". And surely enough he was flatbedded to the nearest (no so near) charger pretty soon, was not ""thrown over the wall"" to the Norwegians to deal with this. Is it included in your contract? Sure. Can you expect to be assisted like this? Sure. Does it usually work this way with big companies? Your choice. 
 
Again, good luck with your dealings. 
 
PS: thanks for the first hand comparison. Most of us, including myself most probably, are in different levels of confirmation bias.",2016,6,28
"After almost 4 months of being passed from pillar to post and 2 years of yes we've fixed the problem to oh, it's not fixed, just a wee glitch - it's fixed now. It's broken again I'm afraid and thus I would like to exercise my consumer rights. To what problem the car is fault free, you can bet that I have been less than impressed with renault customer service. That's not to say that the next person will have the same experience. 
 
My first case manager at CS escalated my problem to a senior case manage after about 2 months. After around a month of trying to make contact with the senior case manager via email and telephone I eventually spoke so someone told me that person had left the company. My case was given back to the original case manager. I wrote a letter stating that I wish to exercise my consumer rights by retuning the car for a replacement or refund and I'd be happy to accept either. I stated sections of the consumer rights act 2015 which clearly outlines I have up to 5 years to return and 6 months to reject. They wrote back to say I cannot reject the car as I've has the car for more than 6 months. They totally ignored my right to return and did not respond when I highlighted this. 
 
I wrote another letter to the dealer as my contract is with them. They have Been engaged in testing the car on different chargers and have found the fault I often receive, they are investigating if further for a report. It was not easy to get them to do this. Obviously this report will need to be analysed by all parties. The garage is still in contact with CS but they still won't respond to me. 
 
I contacted RCI to inform them of the negative impact all this has been having on my life and the financial loss I have incurred as result of purchasing this car over and above repayments. I again stated my consumer rights. This was about 3 weeks ago. I received a letter to say that the have opened a case for me and they will be investigating it further with the dealer and CS. I called last week to recieve an up date, the person who was assinged to deal with with my case was off unwell (these things happen) and they couldn't tell me much more. So I'm still patiently waiting. I truly don't think I'm being the unreasonable one here but maybe they see things differently. I'm hopping to hear more over the next couple of weeks. 
 
Kotek I understand that demanding, depending how it's done, can rub people up the wrong way but you need to be firm and have a strong stomach in my experience. They will (only in my experience) try to fob you off - damage limitation. It's just realistic from a business point of view that they do this but there has to be a tipping point - I'm still engaged in finding it.",2016,6,28

The Renault rep advised me that he will contact the dealership and arrange for me to have a meeting with the sales manager so we can discuss the options of my rejection of the Zoe.",2016,6,28

"Big up to Arnold Clark Stiring. I just got off the phone with their service manager who has informed me that during their tests they were able to confirm that they found the fault when attempting to charge on 4 different rapid chargers. They were able to test the chargers as they had the equipment to do so with them. According to their findings the chargers were not at fault. They have put together a detailed report to put to renault technical who had previously said there didn't appear to be a fault with the car and blamed the chargers without testing them. Now renault technical won't accept the case from stirling because they are not an ev dealer. However they had a specalist carry out the tests and write the report to deliver to renault bishopbriggs who said there was no fault on the advice of renault technical. Bishopbriggs is an ev dealer so they need to raise the case with renault technical who will liase with (as they did previously) renault customer services. The report has also been sent to RCI. 
 
This is not my thread but I just wanted to point out that the dealer in this case has been most helpful. That being said it's important to log everything with all other parties as the dealer needs their help going forward if any replacement or refund is to be granted. Renault supplied the faulty product after all. 
 
Renault UK seem to make returning a faulty product a difficult process for the consumer. That being said I'd like to say that despite my experience to date perhaps I've been a bit unfair to renault CS department. Actually it seems the problem transcends them.",2016,6,28

Renault UK have spoken to the Sales Manager at the dealership and instructed him to set up a meeting with me so that he can present me with my ""options"" regarding the rejection. That meeting is to be today at 10:30. I'll let you know how it goes.",2016,7,7

Hi kotek. Did you have a favourable meeting? Are you any further forward? If you don't mind me asking :/,2016,7,13
"As it happens, I'm not long home from the dealership, having had the meeting with the sales manager today. 
 
The top and bottom of it is, I've agreed to the option of a replacement vehicle. The sales manager has calculated a figure that he needs from Renault, to make up the difference of what the Zoe is now worth and the deposit needed to start up a new 2 year PCP on a new Zoe at the same monthly payments as I'm on now (£95 batt + £35 car = £130 per month). The sales manager is waiting to hear back from Renault as to whether they are going to foot the bill, or whether they prefer me to simply walk away. 
 
My preference at this time is to change the faulty Zoe for a new one. An hour or so after the meeting my contact at Renault Customer Relations called me to say he's spoken with the sales manager after our meeting and he's aware of all that I wrote above. He will now pass this to his own manager to make a decision. I'm waiting to hear the outcome.",2016,7,13
"I can't see the financial motivation to pay you to keep you on the same deal you had with them. 
 
If they are not bothered about you as a customer, or bad feedback, then they'll just let you reject. Cheapest option for them. 
 
Paying out to keep you on the same deal is a big expense. 
 
Easiest option for everyone is to let you reject, then offer you a carrot of a good will gesture in a cash lump, so you can't really complain that Renault only did the bare minimum but they did actually recognise the inconvenience.",2016,7,14
"Well, my contact at Renault Customer Relations called me yesterday.  @donald  is correct, Renault have decided it's not worth their while changing the faulty car for a new one. Apparently it would cost them £5250 to bridge the gap between paying off the finance on the faulty Zoe and supplying a new one. Of course, these numbers are just show-and-tell anyway, the fact of the matter is simple - the car is dangerous, not free of defects and therefore not fit for purpose. You would think that a manufacturer as large as Renault would want to swiftly relieve me of the faulty car and swap it for a new one ASAP. But apparently not. 
 
So I sent the dealership a letter confirming my rejection of the faulty vehicle, enclosing with it the spare key and the V5C. I called RCI and they said they won't stop the payments until the dealership have contacted them. I'm not keen on cancelling the Direct Debit, at least for this month, as I don't wish to hurt my credit score. We'll see what the garage say now. 
 
Renault Customer Relations, by the way, cited their reason for not wanting to financially support the replacing of the vehicle as because the fault had not been replicated by the dealership on either of the two occasions the car had been in with them (it's still in with them). Renault suggest I take the car home and wait and see if it happens again. Sorry, I told him, not on your nelly. It's unreliable, unsafe and unfit for purpose. Makes me feel they don't believe me that the fault is present. Thank god I took photos. 
 
I certainly WON'T be buying another Renault again, ever.",2016,7,20
"@Kotek Besar  Sorry to hear that and a strange state of affairs. It's not that you programmed the word ""DANGER"" in the dash message. Good luck with the rest of this disappointing process :-/",2016,7,21
Hi kotek. I'm sorry to hear that. I really hoped that given the nature of your fault and your rejection rights that renault would be more ethically responsible. Of course it doesn't mean it's over but it doesn't need to be so arduous for the consumer either. I totally empathise. Come on renault this really isn't good enough! Let us know how you get on kotek. I'm still battling too. It's no fun!,2016,7,21
"Update: after 7 weeks of the mechanics not being able to find the fault, I sent an email to Renault customer service to ask if I need to also let the dealership that sold me the car have a go at it. There's some kind of rule that says the seller has to be informed of the error within 8 weeks (different country, different rules) and be allowed to try to repair it if you're going to return a product. Didn't get an answer to that, but the next day the dealership called and said that they've found the fault: the onboard charger was damaged. I guess Renault stepped up and finally helped them.  
 
Apparently they were not allowed to do anything with the car without having a Renault technician in France on the phone with them, to avoid injuries from high voltages or some such thing. Which explains the long wait.  
 
Now we're at week 11, it's supposed to be repaired around the end of July.",2016,7,21
Kotek contact trade and standards. They deal with these sorts of things all the time and should be able to give you the most accurate advice and put you in touch with all the relevant trade regulating bodies. The 2015 act gives you stronger rejection rights. In terms of the refund I think it takes in to account acceptable use but the product was faulty so it shouldn't be the second hand value. That's as far as I have been led to believe.,2016,7,21
"Totally agree it's all about interpretation, impact on the consumer and specific circumstances. Its just a shame that huge multinationals force honest consumers to take it that far before they practice ethically responsible trading IMHO. Ive seen this sort of attitude first hand in a pervious profession. I honestly don't mean to offend. I think its just the way the world works with a few exceptions - perhaps I'm cynical. 
 
Totally with badger in black on the replacement. Surely that makes sense all round",2016,7,22
"I believe this an appropriate tale for this thread, and one with (fingers x'd) a happy ending! I have had my Zoe back for 4 weeks now after 3 months in the workshop, have covered 600 miles since and, I'm pleased to say, it seems to be going better than ever. 
 
My Zoe first failed on 1st April. I finally received it back near the end of June. On 2 previous times I received it back I had to return it the same day. (Flatbed). Last time the Service Manager told me it had a string of faults and could be a while. (Electric Motor Failure). I took a hire car this time through Renault Customer Services. 
 
When I picked it up I was told they had replaced 12v battery, Inverter, and Motor. I'm sure other minor parts were changed also, and software updated. 
 
I think I have been very lucky to find a Service Dept who regarded it as a challenge to solve a thorny problem. Its worth noting that as all these vehicles are under warranty, the repairs have to be diagnosed and confirmed by Renault Technical and some dept in Renault is picking up the tab. I know the Motor change was approved during a personal visit by a member of Renault Technical. I'm sure that the quality of staff and knowledge is improving all the time as more training and experience is accruing. 
 
I believe that dealers do not hold spare parts on site and have to acquire these from Renault, who are obviously paying for them at present. Therefore no repair will be quick. (No more 'cleaned the plugs and adjusted the points and it ok now mate'!). In many cases the diagnosis is carried out by Renault Technical and the workshop is then supplied with the part and told how to fit it. 
 
When I bought the Zoe 18 months ago I had a lot of difficulties, and the dealer went through the process of getting a price from Renault etc to buy it back. (A process similar to Kotek's?). I don't know if it was genuine or just a 'blind' but nothing came of it. Remember that Sales sell the car, and the finance, and take your money and pick up the commission. Full Stop, next customer. After that it's down to the Workshop and Renault Customer Services. No dealer wants a 2nd hand Zoe on his books, so they need to get Renault to take it. 
 
I hope this will give encouragement to those on here whose difficulties I have been reading about. You have my sympathies and be assured you are not alone in your struggle against the mighty Renault, and sometimes the result is a good one. These faults occur out of the blue, and its a case of 'there but for the grace of God go I'. As I am constantly told, we are pioneers. 
 
Good luck to us all!",2016,7,24
That surprised me that they say it is not possible as we have done similar things with Santander before (although that time it was because we taxed the wrong car  ).,2016,7,28
"I thought I would check this with my RCI rep, as it didn't sound right, and his answer was 
 
""Yes my belief is that this is possible. You would need to speak to Customer Services and provide them with a ""nil balance invoice"" then we send a modifying agreement to the customer for them to sign and send back. They can be contacted on 0333 009 0230"" 
 
Obviously I didn't mention any names or dealerships and posed it as a hypothetical question.",2016,7,29
"Back from holidays, received a recorded delivery letter from Bristol Street Bradford. The postman forged my signature and popped it through my letterbox. Brilliant. 
 
In the letter, the New Car Sales Manager, who I had sent my rejection letter to, together with the spare key and V5C, says: 
 
 ""I refer to your letter dated 12 July 2016. I am sorry that your vehicle has had an issue requiring repair, and that it has taken 2 visits to our dealership for us to identify and diagnose the fault, which was only occurring very intermittently. 
 
I confirm that we have liaised with the Renault Technical team and propose to replace the PEC (Charger/converter) Unit to resolve the issue. This work would be carried out under warranty with no cost to you . 
 
Your letter states that you wish to reject the vehicle. Unfortunately, you are not entitled to do so. The fault first arose almost 6 months after you purchased the vehicle. Your initial remedy for any fault at this stage is to a repair, which we are proposing to provide, and not to a rejection. It is not unusual for vehicles to develop a fault and this does not provide an automatic right to reject. 
 
Please confirm that we can go ahead and carry out the repair. We will then contact you to collect your vehicle so that you can satisfy yourself that the fault has been resolved.""  
 
Needless to say, I'm thoroughly disgusted by that. Firstly, the sarcastic undertone is stomach-churning. ""Only occurring very intermittently"" - the car broke down and was rendered dangerous and not drivable. This happened twice since I owned the car, the first instance was just before it was six months old and the second instance was four weeks after that. 
 
The law says that if a new car presents a fault within six months of delivery I must allow the dealership one opportunity to repair it. I did that, they failed. The car was with them for 12 days. All they did was clear the error logs, test drive it, then tell me the issue was probably cause by an overhead electricity pylon. An invisible one, since there are none in sight in the place where the car broke down. They returned to me the un-repaired car, which, as stated, re-presented the same fault four weeks later. 
 
It's quite incomprehensible that Bristol Street seems to think The Consumer Rights Act 2015 doesn't apply to them. 
 
The sad thing is, if they'd have diagnosed the fault earlier and offered to replace the PEC (Power Electronic Controller) on the car's first presentation of the fault I would have had to have accepted the repair, which I would have done, without quibble. Rather, I believe Bristol Street didn't take the problem seriously, they failed to diagnose the fault, were more interested in trying to sell me tracking for my six months old tyres (they pushed this at least three times on me) than actually trying to fix the car. 
 
I haven't replied to the letter yet. I called Renault Customer Relations yesterday to speak with my case handler. He was on another call and his colleague said he would ask that he calls me back once he's free. I didn't receive a call back. I'll call him again shortly. The nightmare continues..",2016,8,19
"We have have owned 3 Zoe's to-date (Zoe No 1 was 9th in the UK) and all 3 have had this fault at on time or another and yes this fault is well know in Zoe's just read the forums. 
 
I have experienced this BCI first in May 2013 and on our Zoe-i that needed a new BCU just last month so Renault seem not to be on the ball with this one  
 
Best case scenario is lock the car walk away and BCI will clear after about half an hour. 
Worst case scenario when BCI will not clear Zoe was flat-bedded to Renault ZE Wolverhampton where it had a new BCU (battery charge controller unit) unit fitted and Zoe No 3 was away for a few weeks. 
 
This is our own experience with nothing made up! 
 
Do not charge the 12v battery or mess with any other part of the car as with our Zoe No1 wife and I where blamed for not plugging the charger plug in correctly (I kid you not) then it was the home chargers fault etc etc 
 
Zoe No 3 does seem fine now after its new BCU (at just 520miles) 
 
Zoe is a fantastic EV when running but can be a little flakey at times but stay with your Zoe as it will be repaired eventually but I repeat do not try to fix it yourself and why should you?",2016,8,19
"I have read your post three times. Let me start that I do understand the gist if the Consumer Rights Act, but know nothing of how that works in real life. It seems to apply to a car as well as to a 15 quid water cooker, which can complicate things when it comes to execution. With that said, it seems to me that you are right in the ""de jura"" sense. 
 
I think people should not be shoved around AND if you're on the short end you should act and not whine too much. Vote with your feet. Hats off to you. 
 
However.......... 
 
1. It seems you are furious at the dealer (don't blame you, that entire clear faults, pylon story is ridiculous!!), but (had they fixed it) quite happy with the car. I think it is something to consider: what do you really WANT? Reject the car because you're fed up with the dealer? To make a point? Or because you genuinely lost faith in your ZOE (after PEC replacement *) )? Or would you rather have a nice well behaving ZOE? 
 
2. You seem to be quite disappointed in the dealers reply. With the utmost respect, I think that is slightly naïve. They are just fighting back and like it or not, that is to be expected. 
 
3. I would be extremely careful to fight your fight in this public arena. Sure it can create leverage, but it can also create a ""drop dead you"" attitude. Rest assured that Renault UK and maybe your dealership follows this thread with more than casual interest and as said, the result can work for you or against you. If they will conclude at some moment in time feel there is literally nothing they can do to make you happy, rest assured they will do nothing.",2016,8,19
"Pompous nitpicking: it seems like dealers on your end of the pond make up the names of what they replace. BCU? PEC? Don't exist in the ZOE. If you want to get into a discussion with your chief mechanic: 
 
BCB: Connection box and charger (top metal box on the Q210) 
PEB: Inverter and DC/DC converter (metal box between the BCB and the motor on the Q210) 
LBC: battery management computer (inside the battery pack)",2016,8,19

"Perhaps you are right, it is to be expected that the dealership fights back, but in refusing to respect my rights under the law they are, very quickly, making very sure that I will not give them any future business. Often the way a firm handles a complaint has a significant influence on the customer's future buying decisions. 
 
Initially I wanted for the faulty Zoe to be replaced, and the dealership were willing to do this. Then when they asked Renault to support the funding of the replacement and Renault said no, the dealership's willingness to replace the car vanished. Right now, all I want is for my legal rights to be respected. The car presented a dangerous and immobilising fault within six months of purchase, I gave the dealership the opportunity to repair it and, while they kept the car in their possession for 12 days, they failed to repair it, they gave the car back to me and four weeks later the fault returned. 
 
I don't wish to whine, I wish to vote with my feet. I've respected the dealership's legal right to one attempt at repair. All I want now is for the dealership to respect my legal right to reject the car.",2016,8,19

Does legislation mean nothing in this country anymore? 
 
I also just came off the phone with RCI Finance. As the car is on PCP, and they are still taking my money every month, they have some responsibility. Amazingly, though I've been on and off the phone with them since day one about this issue, they haven't actually logged it as a complaint. Apparently that only happens when I utter the words ""I wish to make an official complaint"", otherwise all they do is log the call but do nothing. It used to be that any expression of customer dissatisfaction was a complaint and should be logged accordingly. Anyway, complaint with RCI now raised..",2016,8,19

I've asked for some assurances in writing before I take the car back. They replaced the BCB unit and have said it's fixed. All due respect - they have told me this before. The intermittent fault which has been present in the car since purchase still remained. All I'm asking is that they admit to me in writing that if I see the fault again within the warrenty period of the part that the most recent attempt to fix the problem has failed and that the underlying intermittent fault the car has shown since purchase still remains. They are so far refusing to do this. In the next breath though they tell me they are confident they have fixed the problem - go figure.,2016,8,19

Zoe - Q210 2013 owned from nearly new (900 miles on the clock) back in October 2014. 
 
No problems (bar the occasional BCI) for 11000 miles and 18 months of happy motoring. 
 
Last month I plugged into a local Podpoint charger which promptly tripped and went blank. From then on I was unable to fast charge on any charger, however, slow charging was still ok.  
 
Booked into Evans Halshaw Sheffield who replaced the charging system after two weeks (hire car provided after contacting Renault UK) Picked it up last Friday, seemed to be working again but got an error message by text while charging on Sunday saying the charge had stopped unexpectedly. Returned to the car to find the 'Electrical failure - Danger' message on the screen.

"Thanks to PICG and other tax incentives, we are  already  at the point where TCO of a new BEV is lower than an equivalent petrol car, if someone can charge for free at work or at home (ideally overnight low cost rate).  
 
For example, at £30K the ID3 Life model is not much more than a similar spec petrol Golf with DSG but operating costs are less. Obviously there are lots of reasons why most buyers will still choose the Golf. For example they need more range, faster fueling, tow, can't easily charge, OK with a lower/cheaper spec, etc. Of course, VW need that to happen as Golf production in Europe will probably be 5x the ID3 for 2021. 
 
Cheaper BEVs are coming too, the Fiat 500 starts at below £20K and the Dacia Spring will be around £15K, which starts to open the market to people with lower monthly budgets.  
 
Residuals on used EVs were strong because demand grew but supply was relatively limited. People were buying lower range EVs (Zoe, Leaf, Soul, etc) as they are great for commuting or 2nd car use.

"Lots of interesting ideas here. Only time will tell how it works out. 
 
There's one other issue I would add, which is the impact of sunk capital costs on the pricing of ICE cars. At present, all the manufacturers will have their ICE manufacturing plant included as assets in their balance sheets, and the depreciation of these assets will be included in the cost of manufacture reported internally by their accountants. But once the decision is made to retire the plant it will be written off and the depreciation need not be included in the internal costing. That will leave significant scope for price reductions of ICE cars during the phase out. 
 
Exactly the same thing happened during the move from TVs with cathode ray tubes to LED flat panels.",2020,11,1
"When we talk about the ""cost"" of purchasing or using an ICE car, one thing that doesn't always get mentioned are the externalized costs (ie. a cost that is paid for, or suffered by, someone other than the person or organization that created the cost). If an ICE car drives past me on my bicycle, the ICE car's air pollution poison my body, and its noise pollution assaults my ears. We mostly talk about ICE car air pollution, but after a long bike ride on busy roads I sometimes arrive at a destination and I think I'm talking normally but the people around me ask me to stop yelling because the assault on my ears has temporarily changed my perception of what normal volume should be, so don't discount the significance of ICE car noise pollution. 
 
In most jurisdictions, the taxes and other penalties that an ICE car driver pays (that an e-car driver doesn't pay) don't fully compensate for the effect on the environment, let alone the effect on the people in the vicinity of that pollution. Given that fact, there's arguably a falseness to ICE cars being less expensive. IMO, this strengthens the argument in support of increasing incentives on new EVs and/or adding new taxes on top of ICE cars. Every ICE vehicle taken off the road is less air and noise pollution in the places where people live and work. In Norway, about 60% of new car sales are pure EV, and about 80% are plug-in of some form or another, and that's driven by the tax system that incentivizes EVs and punishes ICE vehicles. ICE cars shouldn't be cheaper than e-cars, and Norway's shown the way forward for the rest of the developed world to follow. 
 
As incentives on new EVs increase, it pushes the price down for used e-cars down which help create an option for poorer people. It's not a perfect solution, and would work better in a wealthier country and less well in a poorer country, but it's the best we've got unless and until the cost of new e-cars hits lower thresholds. I think that will happen over time, as economies of scale increase. Might take 15-25 years, though.",2020,11,6
"I noticed some people questioning whether EVs are likely to exceed a 14 year average life span. I also noticed some people complaining about constantly increasing battery sizes. I'd argue these points are related. I think new e-cars today will exceed 14 years on average, but that it's partly through larger batteries that will allow the car to still be useful decades into the future despite battery degradation. If you usually drive 50 km a day or less, and your car starts with 350+ km of range, it'll take a lot of degradation before that battery isn't giving you what you typically need anymore. Early signs are promising, as the Nissan Leaf hits 10 years and counting. Yes early Leafs had battery chemistry issues, especially in hot climates, but battery chemistries have improved dramatically based on that experience, as have thermal management techniques. But 7 year old Leafs (which had improved battery chemistries) are holding up well in cooler climates, as are some 10 year old Leafs in those same areas, so I'd take that as a very positive sign.",2020,11,6

"There are 2 parts of this which irritate me:  
 
Firstly, the lack of notice. One month to re-budget for a household's motoring is just not fair. Yes, we all knew that it wouldn't be free forever, but as OLEV / HMRC have said when setting BIK rates for 3-4 years in advance, confidence in the cost of ownership is really important to facilitate take-up.  
 
Secondly, the lack of consultation. We're a really small community, Chargemaster know who we all are from our RFID cards. MK Council and/or Chargemaster could have engaged with us, put forward various models and sought feedback from real users. The approach taken here is just going to get everyone's backs up. 
 
Fundamentally, EV driving will only get traction if the cost is lower than petrol driving. For those of us with EVs, I suppose we will mostly have to just put up with Chargemaster's new pricing (or charge at home, as most have said). What worries me is the owners of tomorrow - people who will do the same sums we did before we bought (monthly lease / HP + fuel + road tax + parking) and decide that at 20p-25p / mile it's just not worth the hassle that comes with an EV.",2014,3,3

"I emailed Charge Master last night just to follow up on the conversation I had earlier in the day……….. 
 
I have copied their response below, now I KNOW that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing 
 
 
Dear Mr G 
 
Thank you for your e-mail. 
 
Milton Keynes (along with many other local authorities across the country, including London) has made the decision that electric vehicle charging needs to evolve its own economic model instead of depending on 100% financial support from the ratepayer. The operation of the Milton Keynes estate of 170 charging points was put out to competitive tender last year and one of the factors taken into account in selecting an operator was the competitive level of tariff that would be set. The successful bidder is obliged to pay for the electricity, operate and maintain the sites and invest significantly in a contractual commitment in respect of extending the charging network each year. 
 
I can assure you that the economics of operating a network of charging points are very tight. 
 
Broadly this is what it costs - this is how your £1 for a 3kW charge is broken down: 
17p VAT 
42p Cost of electricity including standing charge 
12p Maintenance including regular safety checks 
6p Data handling and communication costs 
4p Spare parts 
6p Call centre operation 
9p Provision for investment in new sites 
4p Contribution towards overhead and profit 
 
Electric vehicle users in Milton Keynes are given the privilege of free parking often in premium spaces close to the key shopping areas which in many cases can out way the cost of re-charging their cars. In addition Milton Keynes has recently allocated a further 50 parking bays to be reserved solely for evs ensuring that parking spots are generally always available for electric users in the future. 
 
This week Milton Keynes is announcing the completion of 14 new rapid chargers at no cost to the ratepayer which further supports the use of evs in and around the town. Several dozen additional charging points will be installed across and around Milton Keynes over the next year and this further supports the case that Milton Keynes is one of the most favourable locations in the country to own and operate an ultra low carbon vehicle. 
 
kind regards 
D",2014,3,4
Lol what a joke,2014,3,4
"Just to add to my last one, charging hours are not anything like kWh so with the rapids in particular you'd get much better value (but less comfort) charging with only 5-10% charge left than doing a ""safe"" top up at say 20-30% charged due to the rate dropping off. 
 
And when I did have petrol, despite the ""price match"" game, I could choose from many different local suppliers, that choice doesn't exist with car charging. 
 
Wonder how this works with competition regulation actually?!",2014,3,5
I think this is dead in the water... who will queue at a rapid charger to pay £8.50 to drive ~70 miles or £17 to drive ~85 miles?,2014,3,5
How much does it cost to park a non EV in MK ? This amount may make the charging cost more favourable. Will you have to pay if not charging ?,2014,3,5
"Seriously... is anyone going to use CM at any of those rates more than just in an emergency when there is in option? 
 
Anyone?",2014,3,5
Hey I have a new special deal on petrol…………. £8.50 per Gallon any takers?,2014,3,5
"Assuming I get 85 miles from a full charge on a Mk2 Leaf, not out of the question in winter, then that is 10p/mile. 
 
If I drive my ICE with a 50mpg consumption I would use 7.7ltr costing £10.80. 
 
So, on the surface it looks like it might be cheaper than petrol. But is it? 
 
I can never get a full charge in 30 mins. About 80% is about the max I could get in 30 mins because the charger slows down as it fills. So that 10p/mile is not 10p... it is 12.5p/mile 
 
Then there is the fact that no one (well, hardly anyone!) turns up at a charger completely empty. I typically still have 25-50% still remaining. So that 12.5p/mile becomes about 13.5p - 20p/mile and that assumes that the charger doesn't auto stop at 80% as all other rapid chargers do. 
 
Then there is the fact that I occasionally need to start the charger again to get the last 20% if my next charger is at the limit of the range. So, now I will be charged a full £8.50 for just 20% of the charge or 50p/mile. 
 
Now I challenge anyone to convince me that this is good value especially for a Mk1 Leaf which only has a typical range of 75 miles in winter and if your ICE does better than 50mpg then it looks worse still 
 
This is the reality of a fixed fee per charge. It is a complete non-starter and although it is cheaper than my figures suggest if you are a MK resident and join the membership it isn't that much better.

Ecotricity And Tesla charging points now have the pick of the market. Ecotricity have a huge chance here to make pricing easy by linking to customers' home bills at a small premium for RCs. 
 
I fear that it will kill the EV market though. My local BMW dealer has had a Rapid Charger installed just recently by chargemaster... I assume all the new CCS chargers done by BMW are charge master and so have the same pricing structure. A large amount of in city charging is by Chargemaster so will kill the usage of these charge points.  
 
I have a Fiat 500 petrol car. It is similarly sized to a Zoe but now costs approximately £10 less to travel 350 miles if I rely on Chargemaster rapids. As much as I love EVs, there is no way I or any sane person is going to pay a premium to buy the car initially and then pay more than comparable ICE car to run it. 
 
Chargemaster has very little time to seriously rethink this pricing level and structure.

Having only had a quick glance through this long thread and apologies if I have missed anything but it looks to me as though there will be free parking for however long your car is plugged in and you will be charged for the amount of electricity that is used? In which case EV drivers who do not need to charge will have free parking and just need to make sure that the charging side is switched off (something you can do in the Ampera/Volt but not too sure about all other makes) which will result in no cost (might upset other EV drivers by blocking a bay but who would know).

"@ fenlander  Yup. I think you are alone   
 
It is rather niave to imagine that the service levels will improve IMO. CM have little control over ICEing... that is down to the host site... and CM has shown little interest in keeping the network up and running. I suspect their revenues won't be much more than it is now but there will be an expectation of the service now that people are paying so potentially their costs will significantly increase if they are to up their game on level of service. 
 
I saw a Twitter post which hit home with me, it went something like...  
 
 Chargemaster obviously want to make a profit (I would say need if they want to stay in business) but to make profit first you need customers. 
  
Where are their customers coming from? 
 
I fail to see how making driving an EV significantly more expensive than an ICE will help the take up of EVs and build their customer base. If I knew that it was either charge at home or pay significantly more than in my petrol car I wouldn't have bought an EV at all and I suspect that most people will think the same. 
 
Don't forget... you will have the option to use petrol in your BMW i3 and you will then be laughing at us 100% BEV folk that either have to pay these charges or not go at all.

"@ brian orr  We can still be advocates for the use of EVs when charging at home. @ fenlander  seems to want people to buy EVs only for that purpose whereas most people I have met would not consider an EV unless it can be used for long trips. 
 
It is difficult to make a convincing case to buy an EV only for trips locally. I certainly understand that you can often make the case financially but it falls way short emotionally. People want a car they can drive everywhere and don't want the restrictions a 70 mile round trip brings even if it makes financial sense. 
 
If it were just the financials that mattered then I might agree with @ fenlander  but we are dealing with cars... cars tap into emotions and emotions are not logical. If we want EVs to work then they must satisfy the emotions and wants of drivers... not common sense and needs. 
 
This isn't about what people need... it is about what they want and so rightly or wrongly, people want public charging and without it being available and affordable I fear EVs will be restricted to enthusiasts, pioneers, geeks and us (assuming we are not in the previous categories!   ).",2014,3,6

Trying to convince people to buy a car that only meets some of the needs when it will cost more for their other needs is never going to work for the masses. 
 
At the most base of the argument I actually agree with you entirely but I believe your argument ignores the realities of the human factor which way outstrips the common sense aspect of it and I think that to get EVs to the masses we must first tackle the human factor before the common sense. If you win people's hearts you will stand a chance of winning over their minds... if you try to win over their minds when their heart says they wouldn't buy it anyway then no amount of common sense will win them over.",2014,3,6

Ecotricity has the only viable business model of all the rapid charge networks today... whether they make good on their intentions or not... they could do so if they choose to do so as they have a business model that permits it. That is my point. CM and CYC cannot as they have no business model that allows the EV charging network to be anything but profitable and significantly so if they are to survive. They have no underlying revenues to support them if the EV charging network struggles.

"Has anyone seen the BMW 'factor' in the sudden introduction of EV charges by Chargemaster? When we debated the CHAdeMO issue there was a feeling that the European Car Industry persuaded the EU that CCS should be mandated as the only European 'standard' for EV charging and that CHAdeMO was to 'deleted in toto'. There was a feeling that since the European Car Industry was 10 years late, in embracing EV - then one way to catchup was to 'knobble' the Japanese de facto standard CHAdeMO. Now we are in a situation where, despite the almost total absence of CCS equipped vehicles on European roads - the CCS chargers are being installed (widely?) using public money.  
So maybe you can see why I 'smell a rat' with BMW buying into Charge Master and imposing their own ChargeNow subscription service on the existing customer base? I can imagine the Boardroom discussion at Chargemaster when they had to reconcile the BMW charging model, with the existing cost model. It seems quite inconceivable that BMW demanded a level playing field; how could they sustain monthly fees for a service that other brands were getting for nothing? 
In demanding that Chargemaster introduce charges for Nissan, Renault and Mitsu' owners - I'm sure BMW doesn't give a damn about user reaction. 
If our rejection sees Charge Master go into Liquidation - then a buyout by an incumbent equity holder could easily be arranged!

"Hi all, 
 
So I'm finally learning to drive at the ripe young age of 41 and excited to get my first vehicle. 
I'm a techie by nature and I write code in my day job so naturally I'm more naturally drawn to EV's and after all they are the future! 
Apologies in advance for the rambling nature of this post! 
 
I wouldn't currently need the car for my daily commute but would expect to use it some evenings and most weekends. I'm not after anything too flashy but having something with safety features and parking sensors / camera would be great. 
 
From my current research I'm a little torn between getting a 2018-2022 Nissan Leaf (Tekna trim, as at the current prices it seems worth it to go for the used cars with the best trim as usually there is little difference in price). Are there any other good options or is the Leaf really the best bang for buck for the used EVs? I see it uses CHAdeMO which people don't seem too keen on but it seems like there are enough chargers out there, and there's the passively cooled battery thing but after reading on here it doesn't seem like it's as big a deal as some people make it out to be. 
Also on here I can see people are not keen on the Renault Zoe, which was also in the running for me because of the price range, which I was trying to keep in the mid-teens if possible. Are there any other used car options I should consider? How much do I need to worry about mileage? 
 
The other alternative is to get a new car like the MG4 on finance as it seems the class leader but obviously that'll set me back another 10k on what I can get a Leaf for and I'm just wondering if that's really worth it to have something 'new'. 
 
Are there any other factors that I'm not considering that are more obvious to experienced EV users like you fine folks! Thanks for any advice you can give.",2023,3,15
"What's your usage within the evening / weekend trips - will you do long trips, or stuff within the range of the car? If the latter, then the CHAdeMO / CCS debate is of no consequence, as you'll never dc charge anyway. The Leaf is old tech with regards to the battery system now, but still works just fine for more modest use and comes with a good range of tech and good comfort levels. If you need CCS, then the Hyundai Ioniq 38kWh is very well regarded with excellent efficiency and therefore good range for a relatively modest battery. Plenty of choice, all depends on budget and intended use.",2023,3,15
"Weekend trips would generally be 100-150 miles, so pretty much always within the range of the car. The tech and comfort is quite appealing for the price to be honest. Budget is really ideally mid-low teens as I could pay in cash, but could always get a loan if getting a new car such as the MG4 was really worth it.",2023,3,15
"Regarding the Leaf, you’ve identified the two main ‘drawbacks’ in Chademo and passive battery cooling. But if you think they’re unlikely to be issues for you, then they won’t be. The Leaf e+ battery is holding up well and Chademo is still well served. Check out the Leaf forum on here and you’ll see this to be true. And you’re right in that there are very good deals on second hand models currently. Old tech is an ironic phrase for a reliable EV with a decent range. Good luck with your purchase, you’ll get lots of advice…",2023,3,15

I'm rapt (that's kiwi for delighted) with an aging Leaf 24 because most of my trips are within its limited range and I just plug it in whenever I get home. If I had to charge elsewhere, I might be unhappy about having to do that before I used the car again. 
 
I'm also rapt with the old Leaf because it turns out to be quite big inside: fold the seats and a 29er MTB goes in with the front wheel removed. How much will you want to transport?

I've seen a 3 year old zoe with CCS advertised for £13k seems like a lot of car for that money,2023,3,15
I would say the Leaf all day long. My 30kW is great and like ahutcheon says if you can charge at home then the Chademo chargers aren't going to be a problem. I would only bother with a Wallbox if you found a 60kW to buy. The 30 and 40 charge well enough over night to not need it. You not not regret this choice !,2023,3,16
"You didn't say how physically big a car you want and what sort of budget you will have. Also as it's your first car it's worth checking out what the insurance will be. Quite a lot of electric cars are in quite a high insurance group which as a new driver with no history and no claims bonus will hit you quite hard. Generally bigger cars are a bit more comfortable as the wheels are further apart and are a bigger diameter, this means that they ride easier over small pot holes rather than fall into them and with the wheels further apart the angle it drops by when going over bumps is smaller making for more comfort. The downside of a bigger car is that it's harder to park. A lot of bumps and scrapes happen when parking. 
 
Other small cars that might be worth considering are the Mini (short range) and the electric Fiat 500. The EU has chosen CCS as their preferred standard, so cars are migrating to that standard. If you look at the Stats page on ZapMap you can see how many chargers there are of each type and how the numbers have changed over the years. I'd expect the number of new Chademo chargers being installed to gradually reduce to virtually zero as has happened with 43kW AC chargers, it'll take a bit longer than the demise of 43kW AC though as there are more Chademo cars out there.",2023,3,16

"None at all. It's a California compliance car. If they don't build it and sell it they can't sell any cars there, or not as easily. 
 
They could sell it here too, but choose not to. They're not alone. There's a UK RHD Ford Focus EV that's been available for 2 years, not that you'd know it. They've sold about 19 in that time.",2015,8,6

"Hi All,  
 
I was wondering if anyone had any advice. I collect my Fiat 500e this weekend, it comes with a free wall charger (The EasyWallBox be Engie). However I am struggling to get anyone to Install it. 
 
It can be plugged into a standard mains outlet for 2.3KW, or installed properly for 7KW. It has a DPM sensor for monitoring the load on the main fuse. 
 
Ive got a call with Western Power (I am in South Wales) to takes us off a loop and upgrade our fuse to 80A (From 63A), and so far I have had two installers say they cannot help as they are not 'accredited' for that charger. I contacted Fiat and they said to contact Engie, Engie said they do not keep a list of installer and instead just sent me the Installation manual for installers. All the other installers ive contacted have either not responded to their ""contact me"" form, or don't answer the phone 
 
Has anyone had any luck getting this charger installed? 
 
I appreciate that most people would just get a podpoint or something installed instead of the Fiat one if they had to buy one.",2021,7,27
I don't understand why an installer would think they need to be accredited for a particular charger. I know there is huge demand at the moment so maybe they're just too busy to bother with something unfamiliar.,2021,7,28
"As  @mikeselectricstuff  stuff said, there is no legal requirement for accreditation, over and above being a competent electrician and (for England and Wales) being a member of one of the Part P cartels. Any electrician could easily install any charge point, it's not more complex than wiring a hot tub. Day's work at the most, often they only take half a day if the installation is straightforward. Only slight complication is registering the grant application, but that really isn't that difficult or time consuming.",2021,7,28
"Yeah, I was a bit confused about it. Ive not even been able to get a quote from anyone yet. Despite contacting 8 electricians that indicate they install EV chargers. I guess it must be down to their business as you say.",2021,7,28
"To add, this isnt the case with every manufacturer...",2021,7,29
"EO are likely to find themselves in hot water with that clause. This wouldn't be the first time that a manufacturer has tried to create a closed shop like this. A heat pump manufacturer (more accurately a UK distributor) tried the same trick with me years ago, and tried to make out that the product only had a warranty if installed by one of their accredited installers. As I'd bought the thing from a wholesaler, had all the competences and qualifications needed to install it, and had no intention of spending as much as I'd paid for it to get a (pretty pointless for me) chit just to do one installation, I challenged them. Have to say they didn't even argue about it when challenged. I offered to send them photos, but they just backed right off and made it clear that they legally had to honour the warranty as long as the unit was installed as per their MIs. 
 
If anyone gets this sort of challenge from any charge point supplier/manufacturer then I think they need to challenge it. The one proviso is that manufacturers can choose to offer an extended warranty, over and above any statutory warranty, that may be dependent on certain conditions being met. Even then I believe that the onus would be on them to prove that the installation was in some way non-compliant with their MIs, and that the failure was a consequence of shortcomings in the installation. That's probably a pretty tough thing for them to prove, especially if the installer has taken photos at the time (I do this all the time now, as much to assist my memory as anything else). 
 
As an aside, the tendency by manufacturers to try and create closed shops is something that seems to be getting more common. I'm pleased to see that the ""Right to Repair"" movement seems to be countering this to some extent. When my Macbook needs replacing it won't be with another one, that's for sure, it will most probably be this ""designed to be repaired/upgraded"" laptop:  Framework Laptop pre-orders are now open  , primarily because I do not like the way Apple are trying very hard to stop anyone other than their own stores fixing their stuff.",2021,7,29
"Again, back to mikes original query with regards to why installers feel they have to gain the accreditation... 
 
Installers arent going to want to argue t&cs with the manufacturer, regardless of law, easier just to get accredited accordingly... 
 
With regards to doing the accreditation, it all depends on how busy that installer is... they will just say no to spending a few hours sending certs off and doing additional online courses (or whatever the manufacturer requires them to do) if they are too busy.

"Fair play to them for going through the exercise to import it and getting it registered. I wonder how much was paid for it after all the taxes, shipping and fees. No Rapid Charging, so a 24kWh battery is going to make it short range commuter or shopping trolley. What about maintenance or repairs given it's a US spec. If it stops working during someone's weekly commute, what is going to be the timeframe to get a repair quoted for, nevermind fixed. Will insurance be limited to specialists, given the modifications/import status. 
 
In the same way that i3s is thinking, it will appeal to a car fan who wants to own something unusual. I wonder if it will back back on the market in 12 months. If I was looking for a similar size EV, I'd be doing the same as i3s and getting the eUP on a lease which has a full UK warranty, rapid charging and longer range. Or buy a 22kWh Zoe.

"Hi there   
 
I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april. 
 
So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol. 
 
Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too. 
 
I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol. 
 
i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh. 
 
anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3  
 
would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one. 
 
many thanks",2022,2,3
"Mode 3 is the granny cable. See my earlier thread on this as its confusing. After Aug last year, any order placed on the fiat system, regardless of trim level, will come with the 'faster' charge cable. However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard. The dealer had led me to believe the 2nd cable would be included, so in my case they provided the cable free of charge.",2022,2,4
Just did and it is indeed the one you use at public chargers or home wallboxes,2022,2,4
"I just bought a Fiat 500e and I love it. I live in Provo and there are public charge points everywhere. Last night, the day after I bought the car, it was keyed by someone straight to the metal. I live in a rather good part of town and it was in a private drive for the night. Unfortunately, I have to park on the street most of the time and the car is bright orange. I learned due to gentrification there is a huge anti-tech sentiment here akin to San Francisco. I've bought a camera and switched up my insurance but that doesn't help for the damage already done. What on Earth could I do to prevent this from happening again? Is it safe to leave it at public charging ports? What if they do something worse like snapping the charge port while unattended?",2019,2,10
"If it was, as you suggest, ""anti-tech"", does it advertise itself as being electric? If so, take the badges off so it looks like any other Fiat 500... 
 
Ofcourse that doesnt help when your plugged in at public chargers, but then the car was keyed in your driveway... 
 
Given the model (it surely doesnt stand out as an EV unless someones paying a lot of attention to it...), it seems less likely to me that it was keyed because it was an EV, and more likely either a jealous neighbour, or just a random freak coincidence by a passer by etc.",2019,2,11

"I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to :  How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper  
 
Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required? 
 
Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991  https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/

I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it. 
 
But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above. 
 
Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.",2020,11,19

As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.,2020,11,19
Import duty will be the biggest problem I reckon. Unless there’s some kind of exemption for bringing over your own personal car (which I doubt).,2020,11,19
"When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months. 
 
 If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.  
 
Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.",2020,11,19
Always a good idea to get the pros and cons down on a piece of paper and cost against alternatives.,2020,11,19
"Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria. 
 
Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.",2020,11,19
"Do it!  
 
There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting.

My dealer told me they had several 500e standing in the basement, which take up space while their customers wait to lay hand on as long as I do.

"How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands! 
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today. 
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range. 
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc.  
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no  problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk. 
 
Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly. 
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV. 
 
And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster) 
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that. 
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that! 
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise. 
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one.  
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?%  
 
As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!",2021,4,24
"Nice review, I am having a test drive on Tuesday, can I ask what sort of discounts were offered, see we were both looking at the Ioniq 5 on an other forum.",2021,4,24
I saw Jonny Smith’s early review of this and thought it looked great.,2021,4,24
I work in the NHS and with their finance package -Affinity? Would give a £2k discount Straight off For NHS workers. I Will have to read up on it. New car/new model but I am sure as Fiat dealers they can still do a deal.,2021,4,24
"I noticed this site seems to have some really good prices - £23.5k for the La Prima hatch. No connection and I've never used them before, so can't vouch for them.",2021,4,24
"We’ve also got our test drive on Tuesday. Car has been on order now for over a year now and Mrs is very excited, especially after reading this review. As I said on another thread, I think Fiat have got this spot on.",2021,4,25
"Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable.  
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat.  
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell! 
 
Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.",2021,4,25
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.,2021,4,25
Did you find the start up chimes/sound and low speed sounds to be irritating? Or aren’t they that noticeable?,2021,4,25
Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.,2021,4,25
"Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.",2021,4,26
Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now ,2021,4,26
"Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first.

"What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm.  
 
Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.",2021,4,27
"We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything  @MarkyM  said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks… 
 
Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.",2021,4,27
Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.,2021,5,21
Thinking of ordering a Fiat 500e on lease as a second car. What are current lead times like? Has anyone had experience recently?,2022,2,10
"I think it would depend on the spec you want. The dealer network have some models in stock, or on order, so depending on your requirements, you may get lucky with a car in stock, or maybe one that is on order but not locked down, so you could add extras/colour options, but that would probably be 3 month wait for build and delivery.",2022,2,10

Auto car suggest £29k after PICG.  Fiat 500 reinvented as all-electric city car for 2020 | Autocar,2020,3,4
Seen an article and that first editions will be nearly £30k in the U.K. This is a silly price for what is just a city runabout. Why did they not go for a smaller battery and a more basic trim and get the price below £20k. At this rate EVs will continue to be out of reach for most people on average incomes. I think the Government should limit the grant to cars priced under £20k to encourage manufacturers to build more affordable EVs.,2020,3,5

"Typically steering might seem heavier at lower speeds, even wuth powered steering of one kind or another. 
With the recent low temperature could it be that the tyres are under inflated. 
Cars ate generally delivered with a high pressure which the dealer isxtasjed to correct. 
If they do it wrong then an underinfkation if just a couple of PSI can be quite noticeable.

if I remember correctly the dealer sent me a link to register the app.",2023,2,18
"After being interested in the 500e for quite a while, I was finally able to have a test drive last week at my local Fiat garage. Looks like I was the first to try it, as it only had 8 miles on the clock! 
 
In general the car is a real quantum leap over the old 500. I always loved the look of the old 500, and actually bought one in 2009. However I sold it soon after as it was pretty crap to drive. This new electric model improves on the old car in pretty much every conceivable way. 
 
Positives: 
 
Looks great in the metal. 
Finally a good driving position in a 500! Lots of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel. You can sit noticeably lower compared to the old 500. 
The central display in the La Prima I drove was responsive and crisp, wireless CarPlay worked faultlessly. 
Radar cruise and auto lane hold worked very well. 
Performance felt decent. Nippy away from the lights. 
Amazing turning circle! 
I didn't have time to fully test the efficiency, but it seemed pretty good. Range was stated at 160 miles at 100% when I first got in, I drove for 13 miles at a stated 4 mi/kwh on a mixture of motorway and town driving and got back with 7% used and 147 miles left on the GOM.  
 
Negatives 
 
Although the interior looks great, there are a few bits where the materials feel cheap. 
The ride was generally good, but it tended to thump over serious bumps. Nowhere near as bad as the old 500 though. 
 
Overall I really liked it! It's a pity I couldn't keep it for longer to really see what the efficiency is like and what it's like to live with. I'd also be interested to see what deals are available, at the right price it could be a really compelling package!",2021,4,24

"I empathise . Had similar issues . My dealer was useless and I turned to Fiat Customer Services for issues . Yes software problems do continue . eg. I frequently have to to reset the radio to get the live traffic information to show on the navigation system.

We've been offered a 500e as a rental car, but would like to know if it will cover my wife's daily 100 mile round trip commute at 60-70mph all the way, heating on, etc. 
 
Our Zoe uses about 40kWh to do that in today's weather so the Fiat's 42kWh battery seems a bit tight unless its efficiency is better than the Zoe. 
 
Thanks for any advice!",2022,12,2
"Is that 100 miles each direction or 50 miles each way?  
 
I'd think not quite but if it's only temporary ie a few weeks it might be ok if there is charging somewhere. Granny charge at work? The fiat comes with a brick. Top speed might have to be shaved to 65 rather than 70. 
 
Onto have given a few youtube channels the 500e for a month so it's worth checking out what they have been doing with them. There's a sudden flurry of 500e content.  
 
Corsa E wouldn't and you also have the lying useless range meter that would show 200 miles to start then by half battery it would probably be showing 60-70 miles max which does not give confidence. 
 
Can you get another Zoe ie a rental EV that actually does the trip ok?",2022,12,2
I believe the 500e battery is only 37kWh usable. EV Database quote ranges of between 100 miles (cold highway driving) to 220 miles (warm urban).,2022,12,2
"Leaf is really bad in cold weather. You lose even more capacity as it has no thermal battery management at all. It is however very quiet and well built. First day I had it to do 100 miles in a day we had to stop on the way back for a coffee and a top up as it was so squeaky bum. I wasn't impressed. 
 
The cabin temperature of 24c in a Zoe is about 20-21 in normal car though. The Leaf would melt her face off at 24c. I had to put it down to 19.5 as that was close to the 23C or so I had to have in the Zoe to get any heat at all out of it ",2022,12,2
"199 WLTP I'd be disappointed if you couldn't get it to do 100 miles. As its a rental charging to 100% every day woudln't be an issue and if you have off street charging I'd think it'd be fine? 
 
as mentioned, for a temporary vehicle if it struggles in really cold/wet weather dropping the speed by a few mph will make barely a dent in the trip length but help with the 'MPG'",2022,12,2
"Thanks guys. My dilemma is that it won't be me driving it and I'm not sure wifey wants to add a need to charge at the destination to what is already an excessively long day. I might have been a bit pessimistic with my Zoe consumption estimate, but it's still in the 30-40kWh range at this time of year. With 37kWh usable as mentioned above, that's not much margin for a bad weather evening. 
 
To top it all, wife is tied up at work in meetings, and I'm loath to make the call without talking to her first as it affects her most. On the other hand, the £75 a week the ICE is costing us for the commute makes getting back to a £2 a day EV commute quite attractive!",2022,12,2
"A month of range anxiety? I'd live with that personally but if it were my Wife I wouldn't want to live with her living with that.    
I can't believe that it's not going to achieve 3 miles/kWh even in the winter, even my MG4 managed it. An e-tron 55 on the other hand...",2022,12,2
"Yup, if it was summer I wouldn't be fretting, but I know from experience that cheaper EVs like the Zoe, and presumably the Fiat if it's at all like the other cheaper Stellantis EVs, struggle once the mercury gets lower, and we're heading to the coldest part of the year. Also, the repair time for the Zoe is ""undefined"" because the part they need is unavailable and they say the only way to get up the priority list is to hand the car in to the garage, lol.",2022,12,2
What other cars can be rented? I'd think a long range MG4 would be better. Or can they get the 62kWh leaf?,2022,12,2
"Not a huge choice, Renault offer just a basic car to keep us on the road while the Zoe's on its sick bed. So the 500e, a Leaf or a small ICE (Micra, Aygo, something like that).",2022,12,2
"Don't you have a rubber doorstop to tiewrap behind the accelerator? 
 
Gaz",2022,12,2
"I'd have thought that the Leaf will do 100 miles most days, as long as its nearer 60mph than 70. I would say my e+, with the bigger battery, would be OK for 150 under most conditions, and it's got <50% more range than the standard model. (Even though the battery is slightly over 50% more capacity, it isn't as efficient due to the weight increase.) 
 
But you will need to know where to charge on a really bad day. And obviously, if your wife can see it is going to be a bad day, slow down and reduce heating.",2022,12,2
"Thanks all!  
Finally managed to catch the wife on the phone. As I suspected, with us heading to the coldest part of the year and with a fairly high stretch to go over on the commute she was reluctant to add more faff and worry to what is, to be fair, already a very long day for her. We decided to plump for the small ICE in the end to eliminate any worries. 
 
Pity really, as my wife loves the Zoe and wouldn't be without it, but a change with such impactful possible consequences being made sight unseen was understandably a step too far. 
 
It's a ""curse of the early-adopter"" type of scenario - if this had come up in six months then charging at the destination would not have been an issue as her work intends to install a row of 22kW chargers but for now she would be reliant on a single CPS rapid and an unreliable 22kW post in a village where the Tesla drivers like to get their fill of the free charging.",2022,12,2

"Just joined this forum. I live in Oregon, USA, where I bought a used (3-year lease turn-in) 500e in January. Absolutely love the car. I can drive all over the metro area and in a month with a lot of driving it costs me as much as $6 in electricity. Very zippy little car and great for city parking. The only downside is the low front, which routinely scrapes going in and out of driveways. I can see why this is the best selling used EV right now. As wholesalers buy them up and ship them to used car dealers outside California, they may become more readily available. If so, I recommend them!",2017,10,13
"Fiat500 is massively popular in Europe but we have no chance of seeing a 500e as Fiat currently don't make a profit on them.

So in coclusion FIAT have a car that they could produce and make a profit and get a great start in the inevitable transition to EV. They wont because the chief exec hates EVs. I predict that sooner or later there will be no more FIAT unless they get rid of this prat.,2017,10,14

"There are a few that have been brought over from the states to Italy. A car sharing scheme in Turin (I think) has a few. 
 
The high cost of import is less of an issue here as used car prices are so much higher. While you can pick up an early leaf for £7k in Britain, it would cost me €5k just to get a 1990 Fiat Panda Elettra with 2 seats, lead batteries and a range of 35km. 
 
On a wider note, thinking about Fiat and electric vehicles, you have to consider that Fiat sell over half of their annual European production in Italy, so unless something works in Italy they are unlikely to do it. Here are a couple of the reasons why the spread of electric cars in Italy is going to be difficult without some changes at a national level. Firstly, power limits. In Italy we can't just use as much power as our main fuse can take at any moment and be charged for it, we have to choose a limit (3kW, 4.5 kW, or 6kW) and the standing charge jumps for those requesting a higher limit. From this you'll see that having a domestic 6.6kW charger is not possible as you are already over the highest limit, so you are left with 3.3kW, which is unattractive to many. Secondly, electricity prices are much higher here than other parts of Europe. It would cost me €8 to charge a 24kWh battery from 0 - 100%, and that is more than it costs for the equivalent distance worth of petrol in our Punto. So, unless you really want to, and there are some (but not many) people that do want to, there is no economic case for the switch yet, and until there is then people won't switch and Fiat won't spend money building cars that they can't sell at home regardless of the views of their boss.",2017,10,18
"If electricity prices are so high in Sicily then that is where the problem lies, and is where the people should be focussed on forcing change. That is, of course, unless someone is being made 'an offer they can't refuse', to keep things as they are.  
 
In a place with a great sunshine record the answer could be for everyone to install PV. Payback times would be short due to the mains price. Coupled with home battery storage then local EV transport would be very economical.",2017,10,18
You make some good points but I don't want to turn the thread into a discussion about Italian politics. I was just trying to point out that Fiat's lack of enthusiasm is due to more than Marchionne.,2017,10,18
"Hopefully when Mercedes starts competing in Formula E, Ferrari will have a change of heart and go head to toe with them in the 2019/20 season. Then maybe the 500e will finally have its day in the sun and Italy will change its opinion of EV's and all the necessary incentives to get them accepted... ",2017,10,18
"If you are thinking of importing one, I'd first have a word with your local Fiat garage. 
You don't want to get it, and go there with a problem and they say there's no way they are looking at it, as they don't have any manuals, diagrams tools etc, training , for the HV system.....  
 
But I too wish they'd sell one in the UK as a Zoe / eUp rival .... I'm sure it would go down well in the Nordics and low countries.",2017,10,20
"You can add me to the list of 500 owners who would've happily traded in their 500 for an ""e"" here in the UK! I have owned nothing but FIATs and Alfas all my life. The 500 with an electric motor must be such a joy to zip about in! It has always been a great city car, so electrification would seem to be the obvious next step in its evolution. Its great to hear that they are still going strong after 3 yrs too. Bodes well.  
 
Real shame we cant get any in Europe. Instead, next week, (hopefully) I am driving my current 500L Diesel over to BMW, where it is being part-exed for a brand new BMW i3 94ah rex.

"Hi, 
I normally drive a Zoe but it's going off the road today, possibly for some time, for a repair. I've been offered a Fiat 500e as a replacement, It's possibly the 42kWh version, but I don't know if other sizes are available - the garage quoted a 160 mile range but the Fiat website says ""up to 199"". 
 
I'm just wondering if there's any ""gotchas"" about having a different car temporarily, eg. 
 
1. My wife does a 100 mile round trip commute at 60-70mph. Will the car need charged to get back home? At this time of yea our Zoe uses around 40kWh to make that journey. 
 
2. Does the Fiat have standard (type 2) home charging? We have a Zappi at home. 
 
3. Is the Fiat CCS for fast charging? 
 
Anything else we should watch out for?",2022,12,2
"I've owned one for a year. There is 28kwh battery option but 42 is the standard. 
In summer, the guess-o-range has been as high as 195 but 165 is currently range in these temps. 
Don't do much fast road driving in it, but this week took it 45miles to dealer for service, dual carriageway, 60s mph, got 4.2 m/kwh, so your 100 mile trip should be fine. 
Type 2 charger for home and CCS for fast stuff.  
Great little car IMO",2022,12,2
"I've gone from driving a Zoe ZE50 to my current 500e, and I can tell you that the main issue will be that you and your wife might want the swap to be permanent (as long as you can deal with the smaller boot size and the lack of rear doors, of course). 
 
The GOM has never gone over 161mi for me (I've in fact driven  from north London to Brighton and back  on a single charge, but it was summer and we went the slow way through London both ways)... I think that a 100mi commute shold be fine, although perhaps I'd recommend switching to 'sherpa mode' when the SoC gets under 20% just to be on the safe side. 
 
CCS is supposed to be up to 85kW, I only rapid-charged twice with Osprey 50kW chargers and got around 43 IIRC. 
 
Which trim are you being offered?",2022,12,2
"Mine is also showing 165 miles in this cold weather. But with climate control on it will be less (140?). Try not to change the charging settings and it should be left on level 3. When i first got mine a played around with this setting and switched it to level 5 for rapid charging resulting in battery error message that wouldn’t go away and had to take it in for a service. 
 
preheating the cabin via the app or pre scheduled time will consume about 2% of your battery in cold conditions. I use one step regeneration mode (RANGE mode) and (NORMAL mode) in traffic jams and parking as it coasts and not so jerky. 
 
great nippy little car.",2022,12,2
"Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who chipped in - hadn't been in this forum before and it seemed a bit quiet based on posting dates, so it was great to have such quick feedback from people who own the car.

"Hi -  
 
Question is as per the subject - which of the popular EVs at the moment has what they call ""one pedal driving"" - from what I gather this means that you can set the regenerative braking to such a level that the car will completely stop on its own if you are driving smoothly and anticipating the stopping distances correctly? 
 
Also - does this mean the brake lights come on automatically when you have this enabled as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator?",2022,2,1
"The Leafs have a 1 pedal mode which works very well and you do realise that this mode on all EVs also uses the friction brakes to stop the car. Regen braking can only slow it. 
 
Brake light illumination depends on the rate of retardation and this means both on non 1 pedal and 1 pedal modes. 
On my 62kw Leaf they came on when the regeneration exceeded about 75%.",2022,2,1
"AFAIK, all EVs have regen braking, at least I've not driven one that doesn't. It's more powerful in some than others, some have variable regen settings and some will limit regen when the battery is cold, or fully charged. 
 
All cars are required to have brake lights that come on at a set deceleration rate now, I believe. This means that if regen is high then the brake lights will come on at about the same point that they would if the friction brakes were slowing the car.",2022,2,1
Just curious - some reviews I’ve seen talk about paddles or buttons to adjust the regen. Do they usually remember that setting so you can set and forget? In my Tesla it just has the one mode so there isn’t anything to change so wondered how other cars do it,2022,2,1
Leafs have a switch for e-Pedal so it's on all the time. Cars like the EV6/Ioniq 5 have their own I-Pedal but it needs to be set every time ,2022,2,1
"Hyundai / Kia have 4 regen levels, from coasting (0) to serious deceleration (3). One pedal driving is possible in 95% of the time, only thing is you can't come to a full stop by just lifting the accelerator. You either need to press the brake pedal or pull the left paddle as from 6 km/h or so",2022,2,1
Honda E has one pedal mode. Don't know whether it saves the setting between powering off and back on.,2022,2,1
"Fiat 500e has one pedal driving mode, rarely need to touch the brake pedal at all, once you get used to it. The regen level is preset, no adjustment possible ( not that I have found in the settings anyway)",2022,2,1
"Every modern EV has regenerative braking. 
 
Most but not all can be adjusted in how aggressive that regen is. The Ioniq 5 has four levels as an example. 
 
This is usually done by flicking a button but in some fancier cars flappy paddle. 
 
Some cars will remember the setting, some will go back to a default eg 1(min), 2, 3(max) and defaults back to 2. 
 
Some cars the regen will bring the car to a complete halt whilst others will bring it down to crawling at <5mph and you'll need to put your foot on the brake to actually bring it to a stop.",2022,2,1
Does the auto-hold use the friction brakes when using max gen and coming close to a halt or does it only engage the friction brakes once you come to a stop ?,2022,2,1
"The Enyaq (and I presume the ID3 and ID4) doesn't have 1 pedal. It has regen (and auto regen as you near roundabouts and junctions etc), and it has auto-hold but you still need the foot brake to stop before the auto-hold engages.",2022,2,1
"Isn't it just the Leaf that has true one pedal driving?.. Perhaps the latest Kia/Hyundai do too but I think a lot of cars have a strong regen mode that gets called ""one pedal"". I've heard the Zoe B mode referred to as ""one pedal driving"" which it absolutely isn't.  
 
On our e-Niro in level 3 regen, or the Zoe in B-Mode you can do most of your driving without touching the brake pedal. However when actually needing to stop, the brake pedal is required. Both cars creep like a traditional automatic. It's notable the regen on the Kia is much 'stronger' than the Zoe and it always takes me a moment to re-adjust when swapping between them, so not all cars will feel the same. 
 
I haven't driven a Leaf but my work did try a Kangoo EV demonstrator with one pedal mode and I loved it. No creep, came to a standstill by automatically, gently, applying the friction brakes. Showed the brake lights as you'd expect. Really what all EVs should have and I find it baffling that they don't.",2022,2,1
"The Leafs E-pedal is indeed a true 1pedal mode because the accelerator will apply the brakes to add to the regen if you lift off completely. I.e. the friction brakes are not just used to stop you completely. 
 
(It's easy to compare max retardation, foot off, in B with 1-pedal - there's a big difference due to the friction brakes) 
I used e-pedal most of the time because locally, I had to either slow down to <10mph or stop at a junction and using B would have also required foot on the brake pedal.",2022,2,1
"This looks very cool, and is promised to come in cheaper than the 500e.",2022,1,18
"Will it be less expensive than a Dacia Spring?  
Even if it isn't the market could use a step up from the Spring. There isn't much choice for small basic EVs as the moment.

"My Fiat 500e has been in storage for around a year and is unsurprisingly dead. It won’t charge when plugged into the Level 1 charger. Will it charge if I were to take it to a Level 2 charger, or is it completely dead? 
 
Maybe jumpstart the smaller battery? Is the main battery replaceable or would that not be worth the money/effort? Is there any sense trying to fix it, or other things I can look into trying? 
 
I don’t want to salvage it but I don’t want to go out to where it’s stored and spend money to tow it if there’s no hope. I also don’t want to mess it up more.

We already did a tour from Italy to the UK for a month last year (everything went very well) and this year we want to top that. 
We want to show - the 500e is more than a shopping car! 
 
But of course an EV driver on a road trip needs so much more preparation than with a conventional car. That's why I've opened a travel journal and although we're not on the road yet, I'm already posting important steps, tips and advice for preparation. How to plan, where to charge, which apps in which country etc.

I can't wait to start the journey! 
What are your experiences? Do you already have a long EV road trip behind you?

"Haha - I know Alnair, I am from the UK (New Forest). 
I just LOVE the vegan options in the UK and I miss it every single day here in my exile... Sunny but not (yet) vegan-friendly Italy. 
This time no London for us. 
Last year we took the ferry from Calais to Dover, but this time from the Netherlands to Newcastle, so we will be already up North in England. 
 
I am curious how I will survive on the Scottish Isles and in the Highlands. Last time I had been there I was still a vegetarian and it was ok ish. 
But as a vegan?!? 
I will report in my travel journey. 
It is with live tracking, so you can watch me starving almost live :-D

"I'm sure you'll be perfectly fine 😆  
I went vegan while living in Italy, more specifically in Emilia Romagna, where meat is king 😭 - and I've hitchhiked through all of south-eastern Europe, which is not the most vegan-friendly part of the world... no doubts you'll cope in Scotland (where I'm also headed this summer!)",2023,3,6
"I’ve just got a 500e so wondering how you’ll fit everything in. Presumably you’re two up. Do you permanently fold the back seat down, or is it possible to remove it entirely?",2023,3,6
"If you’re stopping in Belfast while in NI be sure to check out Jumon. Not fully vegan but mostly and very tasty food. you’ve timed it reasonably well, there’s just the start of a half decent collection of rapid chargers here.",2023,3,7
In deed it is very likely that we will stop in Belfast! Thanks for the advice regarding vegan food - can't wait!,2023,3,7
"@EV-Travellers   
Interesting what you are planning. 
Will you also drive through Luxembourg? I couldn't see that on the page you linked. 
You make me confident I can drive to the North Sea Jazz in Rotterdam in July without major problems, I'll pick up my 500e Cabrio next week Friday.",2023,3,7
"Hi ophone, no, Lucembourg is not on our way. We go from Central Italy through Switzerland, Germany, Netherlands and from there we'll take the ferry to Newcastle. 
 
So you'll have the same car like me - 500e Cabriolet. Enjoy it, it is a great little car - and more spacious inside as you think. Very comfortable. 
I have no doubt whatsoever that you'll manage to go to Rotterdam. 
Just prepare yourself with the apps and RFID cards you might need.  
If you follow my journal - that will be (and it already was a bit) a part of it. Maybe you'll get some ideas.",2023,3,7
"For a morning I had the opportunity to try a test car with the same configuration I ordered. 
You're right, it's rather spacious inside, at least for the driver and the co-driver.",2023,3,7
"For short distance we were also already in four - once you got into the car, it is not too bad on the rear seats. But I wouldn't do it for longer than 30 mins or so. 
For our trip we removed the back of the back seat, so now it is anyway a two seater ",2023,3,7
"Just been on a nine mile round trip to the centre of Milton Keynes back to Speak EV central. 
 
On this journey I spotted: 
 
 A white Nissan LEAF (which I then got in and drove) 
 A white Renault ZOE 
 A black Nissan LEAF 
 A white BMW i3 
 A white e-Golf 
 Edited to add: A green and white Wrightbus electric bus 
 None of these were on display or in a showroom (driving by a dealer or EV display would be a cheat, surely). 
 
That's an EV every 1.5 miles (including my own) from  four  five different manufacturers. 
 
Can you beat that?!

"I wonder if Polar is aware that a vehicle is using the charger for commercial purposes ? A manufacturer owned vehicle on road test is most definately commercial purposes. 
 
Seem to remember, back in the days of free, Ecotricity had (perhaps still have ?) a clause in the t&c's of holding an RFID card that forbade using a charger for commercial purposes. 
They obviously never enforced this, as at some rapid chargers EV'ers were kept waiting whilst taxis sat trickle charging to 100% 
 
No way should a manufacturer or any commercial enterprise be allowed to use any charger network for the same price, or less, than Joe Public. 
 
Any manufacturer hoping to enter EV market should be heavily investing in the charging infrastructure, or building their own. Tesla had to. 
 
Those choosing not to do this are riding the bus for free.",2018,5,6
"I use my car to travel to meetings and my company pays for it, so that rules me out then? 
 
I get where you are coming from but it is quite complex and in essence largely unenforceable, would I have a card for business and a card for personal use, it all gets a bit murky. 
 
Do you really want car companies owning or controlling the charging infrastructure along with the Oil companies converting their forecourts to EV pumps? All they will do is monetise it and we will end up paying at charging rather than at the dealerships, once they have a monopoly in it.",2018,5,6

"Our Fiat 500e (red) sustained front body damage on December 31st last year. Car body repairers still waiting for delivery of bonnet and front bumper from Fiat almost 4 months later. Luckily it is still driveable and roadworthy all be it with an unopenable bonnet. If it had been undriveable it would still be off the road.  
Serious delay issues if you have an accident in one of these.",2023,4,16
"That's a bit bad, isn't it? I take it there aren't any in scrapyards?",2023,4,16
This seems to be an issue across manufacturers.,2023,4,16
"There are still huge waiting lists for most manufacturers, so it doesn't surprise me there aren't any spare body panels. On top of this, the 500e has a slightly different body from the petrol 500, so that bonnet won't fit.",2023,4,16
"I've been a diesel driver for years but have hankered after an EV for a few years, doing my research! A family member might want to buy my low mileage 2015 Dacia Duster diesel car, so I'm seriously pondering what to get now. Whilst I love my gadgets I also dig functionality over style, so what some might see as an ugly duckling, is not necessarily ruled out. 
 
If I kept the diesel as a second vehicle I've been seriously tempted by the Twizy as a fun run around but if I'm selling the diesel, I'll need a far more capable vehicle. My only issue is my driveway is barely the length of a car, there's no gate and it's a busy main road (Southampton's very own Piccadilly Circus), where school children walk past every day. This means any car parked on the driveway needs to be reversed on as reversing out into a busy road is a no-go. This also means any electric car cannot have a charge port on the nose, as the darling little feral, pint sized crotch goblins will snap the plug and charge flap whilst walking by, the moment I turn my back! 
 
So, I'm needing a short list of EVs which have  side accessed charging ports.  Budget £15-30k ish. Not that interested in PCP or finance unless I can get a discount then pay it off in full soon after, as I usually own a vehicle until it becomes a liability to keep repaired. New or nearly new / ex demo etc. The ones I can think of right now are: 
 
 
 Peugeot e208 
 Peugeot e2008 
 Vauxhall Corsa -e 
 Vauxhall Mokka -e 
 Citroen E-C4 
 Citroen Berlingo Electric 
 Mini Electric (bit small but it is cute) 
 BMW i3 (do like the styling, but worried BMW aftersales will be costly and painful) 
 VW ID.3 (do I really want to be a software beta tester for what might be Windows ME on Wheels??) 
 VW eUP and the VAG siblings (bit small, only 3kw charging on AC I seem to recall) 
 Skoda Enyaq 
 Smart For-Two / For-Four (excluded as they don't do DC rapid charge) 
  
Tesla, even 2nd hand sub 30k, are off my shortlist as I can't be doing with a company who are so anti right-to-repair and have questionable build quality. 
 
So, what cars have I missed, if any?",2021,7,8
"Forgot about the e-golf. Might be a few ex demo's knocking around still! 
 
Yes, I know Citroen hasn't got the best reputation (French + electrics was historically the butt of many jokes), but if its got manufacturers warranty and a dealer network, you hope you can get by. Same goes for all mainstream car manufacturers really venturing into the EV world. None of them have got it 100% right first time. That said, I've heard too many horror stories about the build quality of Teslas, their customer service ""like it and lump it"" attitude etc. For now, it's off the list.",2021,7,8
"Had my iD3 for a week today. 500 odd miles - not a hitch. Perfect - and a joy to drive.  
I had SW concerns but seems most of those were sorted in the version (2.1) that mine came with.",2021,7,8
"I think I'll have to test drive an ID3 before I make a judgement on it, quality wise. If there are quality issues, I would hope and expect VW to be all over them as they've bet the fortunes of the company on getting their new EV platform right.",2021,7,8
Hyundai Ioniq has a rear nearside port and is about the most efficient EV in your budget if a T is out of it.,2021,7,8
Hyundai Ioniq.,2021,7,8
"If you can fit some of these cars (on your list) by length, then I'm sure the last gen Kia Soul would also fit. The cover pops open sideways, not out, and the actual socket is far enough back that you don't really need that much clearance at the front. I could park with just 6 inches clearance and pop the cover, lean over to insert the plug. You can only lean from one direction though because that flap comes sideways and you need to do this from the other side, it is not central. 
 
I suspect other cars are likewise. You might be over-restricting your list because in fact the actual sockets are usually quite some distance back from the actual cover and the clearance needed is really a matter of inches. There's no need in most cases to be able to actually stand in front of the car to plug one in. YMMV. 
 
Pick the car you want and get a loaner to see if it fits your driveway, before writing it off. 
 
TBH, if you have certain 'demographics' wandering around looking for trouble, to have your plug in lead completely hidden up at the front might actually be what you'd prefer.",2021,7,8
"I always assumed the Hyundai and Kia range were all nose chargers! Good call and I've heard nothing but praise about the EV Ioniq.  
 
Always said it's a shame Dacia don't do an Electric Duster with 150 mile range, 50kW CCS and a sensible sub £20k price ticket to boot. Would sell like hot cakes. Renault might not like that I suppose, not having a more ""premium"" offering to counteract it.",2021,7,8
"When it comes to driveway length, I can just about fit a MK5 Ford Transit SWB on the drive, with the back doorstep touching the bay window brickwork. The risk of a charging plug / flap being damaged pavement side is too high from passers by. I don't think many of them are that callous to go out of their way to damage the cable if it was side entry though as it will be too far up the path for most to bother with.  
 
Also it is simply not safe to reverse onto a busy main road, right next to a junction with a roundabout. Whilst it's a 30MPH zone, many cars are doing that by the time they come off the roundabout and pass my house, doing 40MPH or more a few more yards up the road!  
Also - highway code, rule 201    
 
That said, a neighbour used to reverse off the driveway out into the road every day for years and it was a miracle he never had an accident.",2021,7,8
I think that rule was made before 360 cameras and cross traffic alert ,2021,7,8

In my Chevrolet Bolt, I never touch the brake pedal unless I need to slow faster than regen is accomplishing (it happens sometimes, usually if I wait too late to begin slowing), or coming to a stop on a significant downhill slope. Going uphill is no problem, as the car has a hill hold function. But under 99% of my usual driving conditions I never touch the brake pedal. So that meets the definition of one pedal.  
 
My Niro PHEV would NOT come to a complete stop from regen, as it kicked off at 5 MPH and then coasted. I think the Niro and Kona EVs operate the same, although they do have adjustable levels of regen that my PHEV did not have.",2022,2,3
Just found that Hyundai themselves can't seem to get it right in calling it i-Pedal,2022,2,3
"What this thread really tells you is, if you really want to understand the details of the functions of EVs, get a thorough test drive of three cars on your short list. I would also recommend making the Leaf one of them. It is a very useful benchmark to compare other cars to. 
And that comes from someone who swapped a Leaf for a Lexus EV.",2022,2,4
"The Bolt doesn't require the paddle to come to a stop. Normal regen does that without the need for it or the brake pedal. It simply increased the regen level, and actually does nothing below about 5 MPH. I seldom use it because it's rather abrupt, rather than the smooth increase/decrease that can be accomplished with the brake pedal. But again I rarely have to touch the brake pedal when driving under typical conditions. One Pedal mode provides enough braking/stopping power under almost all conditions.",2022,2,4
"Nobody can deny the EV adoption helped by the LEAF 
 
Without sounding harsh getting a LEAF in 2022 is possibly the second worst EV to buy after the UX 300e.",2022,2,4

"My Ioniq PHEV has variable regen modes I can adjust with the steering wheel paddles. But I wouldn't call it one pedal driving. It's much more for slowing the car when going down hill, the same as you'd do with a manual car putting it in a low gear.",2022,2,5
"Mustang Mach E also has true one-pedal driving, as in when switched on, the car will slow to a complete stop if you take your foot off",2022,2,5
"a good test would be to charge to 100% then get to a relatively high speed like 60mph, then back off. This would generate high kw of regen and that may be more than the battery can take at 100%. Maybe they have a top buffer that can take it for long enough until your battery gets low, or they limit regen, or they use friction brakes. But that would give you an idea I think",2022,2,6
"They should do a carwow test like the 70mph to 0 
 
Take the One-Pedal cars and do a rolling 40mph and simultaneously take their foot off and see which one brings it to a stop the best. 
 
Repeat the test at 100% SoC (for the cars that don't automatically disable One-Pedal and warn you) and see if the friction brakes are used and the stopping distance is identical or longer.",2022,2,6
"I didn’t specify or particularly care how they mechanically do it - point being for ‘cars that can control the friction brakes themselves without driver input’ - it would seem to be logical that they’d try and have a standard retardation when you lift off the throttle - based on speed/slope etc. when regen isn’t 100% possible it can add in friction brakes so you feel no difference 
 
I guess it’s less efficient - better to coast in that scenario to use less energy - but does leave the driver to adapt based on state of charge/battery temperature.",2022,2,6
"In a brake by wire system there's always (at least as of 2022) a fail safe that the brake pedal will cause the brake fluid to get the calipers to grip the pads. 
 
What I'm saying is that is when there is a system failure. Not in normal use. 
 
The brake pedal will be just telling the control unit how much the person's foot is pressed down or released. It's then directly applying the friction brakes (or in the case of EV also deciding if regenerative braking is applied)",2022,2,6

Hi... can anyone advise please... my wife loves the 500 .. we've had 3 and now are thinking to go electric... test driven 2 at 2 showrooms ... the only thing that's stopping us ordering is a possible issue with the brakes... on both demonstrater cars when at really low speed.. as if in traffic and creeping forward.. the brakes make a horrendous squeaking sound... it happened on both demo cars... the sales guys both said it had never been heard before and FIAT have no reported issues with this problem... but when I researched it online there were a few review websites who mentioned this issue a while back... the main one being a carwow review by Mat Watson... can anyone who had bought a new 500e in the last 6 months please confirm or deny if they've had any such noise on their electric 500e ? It's the only thing that's stopping us ordering one... but if those demo cards were mine and I sat in traffic day after day with that squeaking every time ..I would go mad... thanks for any help,2022,8,4
"Brakes on EVs frequently don't see a lot of use due to regen braking.  
You can minimise surface rust by deliberately braking hard occasionally to ""clean"" the rotors, so long as you have access to a suitably straight and quiet road to do so safely.",2022,8,4
"Hi .. thanks for your reply.. my issue is I've driven dozens of new EV's and as of today, only the 500e has shown this issue... one car I could pass off .. but 2 cars and 3 online reviews?... I'm going to need owners to actually give me factual experiences beige I cubit to £32,000+",2022,8,4
"Please let us know how you get on. 
Got a soft spot for 500's...having only sold my 595 Abarth last year.",2022,8,4
"Got mine at the end of April. I'm always in Range mode because I like the 1-pedal driving, so mostly regenerative braking, but I occasionaly use the brakes too (lots of careless pedestrians in London 😓) and I've never noticed any squeaky sound.",2022,8,4
"My Kona gets very grindy tbf, I’ve gotten a dab hand at eco driving and using the paddle to come to a stop so my breaks get noisy. I normally just let the Mrs drive and it gets rid of it 😅 (she’s a “late” breaker… still safe but not regen friendly 🤣)",2022,8,4
"I've noticed with my Ioniq if I leave it parked up for a few days unused, particularly if it was raining the last time I drove it. When driven again the brakes make a scraping sound but not a squeak, the sound clears after a few deliberate hard braking applications as the surface rust is removed from the disks. 
 
Maybe arrange another test drive and deliberately overuse the brakes to see if the squeak reduces or even disappears. Demo cars may not be used very often so the disk surfaces have time to oxidise a bit.",2022,8,5
Yes hammer the brakes and it will go away.,2022,8,5
"Had our 500e since Nov last year, not noticed any squeekyness.",2022,8,8
"More importantly, do they stop the car safely?",2022,8,8
"Thankyou.. I appreciate your input... if anyone needs to know the exact sound I'm looking for then please just watch the ""carwow' YouTube review on the 500e by Mat Watson ... my demo cars made the exact noise",2022,8,8
"We've had our 500e since last November and have now covered ~4000 miles. 
 
Most braking is via regen, so the brakes on the wheels are not applied, however when they are used (ie by pressing the brake pedal) no squeaking. 
 
It is good practice with EV's to apply the brakes every week or two to remove any rust build up on the disks. I do this fairly gently, but at speed - 50mph - having first checked there is no-one behind me of course!",2022,8,16
"Our Zoe makes a strange Squeak coming off the brakes rather than applying them, I'm guessing its something to do with the Regen. I can only hear it with the windows down and the radio off so not too bothered about it, same as the weird harmonics I get at 60mph, I got used to it and don't notice it as much. 
 
However EV's are more susceptible to strange sounds which are normally masked on ICE vehicles so it is a problem, but if you turn the stereo up most of them go away ",2022,8,16
Actually having watched quite a few Carwow test drives lately this is quite a common problem and not just a Fiat but even some very expensive cars have annoying sounds from the brakes sometimes. Matt usually likes to make fun of this trait introducing random picture of certain birds or other animals. ,2022,8,16
Congrats - its a really nice looking car. I think FIAT choose wisely to make it only as an EV and seems customers agree as it sells quite well in most countries.,2022,8,16

"Hey so ordered a fiat 500e icon, I can't afford a home wall box for the moment as they are expensive for me, I do not drive far, so planned on using local fast chargers every now and again and Did plan on using the granny cable for a bit of top up over night which all would do me untill I can afford a wall box. 
 
But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable. 
 
No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end? 
 
I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot",2022,2,4
"I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.",2022,2,4
"As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available. 
 
There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year. 
 
OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.",2022,2,4
"Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A? 
 
I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A. 
 
My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.",2022,2,4

"A friend purchased a Fiat Professional e-Scudo LWB van.  
 
As the Fiat Professional e-Scudo is another van from Stellantis, using the same platform as the Citroen e-Dispatch, Peugeot e-Expert, Vauxhall Vivaro-e, Toyota Proace, etc, the assumption was that it’ll essentially be the same as the others apart from the logo.  
 
So, cosmetically it does look like any of the others apart from the Fiat logo on the front grill and rear. Also feature-wise, as expected, they are all much in much the same.  
 
One exception seems to be that the Fiat e-Scudo version doesn’t have an app of any description. So you can’t check even the basic of settings remotely, or access firmware or map updates when they are released for their sibling Stellantis brands. 
 
As far as I can tell the e-Scudo does already have the necessary hardware built-in, it’s just that Fiat seem to have no intention of enabling the features or releasing an app any time soon.",2023,1,23
"The PSA Peugeot / Citroen forum is incorrectly titled and poorly organised. 
 
With your help, we'd like to fix that. 
 
Stellantis brands are Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, RAM, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall.

I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum. That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out.

"Group cars and vans on the same body together would be the most sensible I think. Otherwise I'd think it would get out of hand very quickly. 
 
It also highlights common vehicles with common underpinnings which quite often have the same issues. Much easier to see at a glance when a new herd of 'why does my X do this' where X is the same actual car but with a different jacket on.",2022,3,21
"Yep, group by floor pan. 
 
Bear in mind the unintended consequences of that logic; you should also regroup VAG products, and likewise HKMC. 
 
(I always thought we should, really...) 
 
It makes perfect sense because both hardware and software are common features/faults, and if the forum is aiming to be a relevant technical resource, then failing to group Audi with Skoda (say) is just badge discrimination of no meaningful benefit.",2022,3,21
"Clearly no effort has been made to group other sibling manufacturers cars together so picking on stellantis is wrong for more reasons than one might think. 
Treat these vehicles the same as everything else. 
From the perspective of what I drive this would mean having a Vauxhall forum with sub forums for Mokka and another for Corsa etc. 
Vans should be treated however they already are. 
Similar for Peugeot and Citroën 
The stellantis name shouldn't even come into it. 
 
Clearly if someone has an issue with a pug 208 and the issue might also relate to a corsa they can search appropriately. 
 
By grouping things together it makes things a lot less clear and more difficult and for no reasonable benefit. 
 
Another example is where posts that should have gone straight into the mokka forum were in random places because the poster could not locate the correct place. 
 
The issue is the amount of work to do initially but once organised correctly the only extra work to do is add a new sub forum for a new car. 
 
Of course, you might want to group opel with vauxhall but that is clearly sensible.

Once the Stellantis forum is organised there is no reason not to group others similarly either. It's all been a mess for a long time.,2022,3,21
"Yeah --- 
 
I fall into the engineer group that drives the car, and couldn't care less about the badge.  
 
Before the internet, I would take things apart, including my brand new cars just to see how they were put together. Now I can google it and let someone else take the risk. 
 
The Munro live videos are influencing my upcoming car decision. I've already removed one car from the long list because I don't like the engineering decisions.",2022,3,21
Which is why I posted this survey instead of just asking the admin team to make the change.,2022,3,21
"I think grouping cars by body makes sense on a forum more devoted to DIY repairs, in depth technical analysis and stuff like that. It will likely make more sense when the cars are older as well. 
 
I think this forum, these days is more about the consumer side where people will take their cars to garages, often dealers and so it is more appropriate for the cars to be grouped by make and model.  
 
Just because the e-208 and Corsa e share fundamental components, that doesn't matter for customers discussing dealers, discounts and the like nor does it have much to do with servicing and maintenance when they are so new. Having all Vauxhall and Peugeot posts in one forum muddies those discussions considerably.  
 
I originally voted for group cars and vans by body because that makes sense to me as a nerd/more technical person but I have changed to car and vans get separate sub-forums based on responses to this thread and considering the purpose of this forum overall. Also, one big benefit of computers, we can have as many sub-fora as we want! 
 
It's interesting to consider the long term implications for this forum really, when all new cars are EVs this could be a busy place, but I guess people will split off as all the dedicated manufacturer forums will have sub-forums for the EVs. SpeakEV can remain as a manufacturer agnostic place for general discussion of EV motoring in the UK (mostly).",2022,3,21
"This is a consumer led forum - not an engineering one. How many Vauxhall / Citroen / Fiat drivers are even aware of the corporate governance of the owning company? Why should they care? In my view - most people will be looking for the brand and car - and that's how it should be organised. It would be useful to then have a pinned discussion or information note ""that the following cars are similar and you may find useful information here too"".",2022,3,21
"Maybe a 'sticky' somewhere that new entrants arrive at, then, which list all the vehicles that have their own sub-forum and where to find that. (And, indirectly, also showing which models are NOT given a specific forum) 
 
Would that serve the purpose you are thinking of,  @MarkyMarc46",2022,3,22
"The vote is still evenly split, which makes it difficult to proceed in a way that won't upset half of the respondents.  
 
Doing nothing is the worst option. I've come up with a compromise that doesn't make too much work for  @Admin  and me while fixing the worst of the problems.  
 
 
I've asked  @Admin  to  
 
1) Change PSA To Stellantis. PSA no longer exist. 
 
Old Name 
 PSA Peugeot Citroën EV Forum  
For discussing Peugeot and branded EVs and PHEVs 
 
 
New Top level Name: 
 
Stellantis: Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat, Vauxhall and Opel 
 
2) Split the Corsa-E and Mokka-E into two sub-forums. 
 
Rename the current one to Corsa-E. Make a new Mokka-E sub-forum. I'll move posts as needed. 
 
3) Create a new Citroën Ami sub-forum in the Stellantis area.",2022,3,23
"A compromise as you say but it does follow the path of having the least amount of work for the admin people so they'll be pleased. 
It still leaves a bit of work to round up all the Vx Pug etc post which went into the general ev section and maybe elsewhere but truly the number of posts are so few it probably doesn't matter. 
The feeling is people looked for Vx etc, didn't find it and moved on rather than posting in the general group. 
After the update people will easily spot what they need to particularly if they realise nothing is in alphabetical order and will look much further down to find Citroën.

4) Add Lexus anywhere you want,2022,3,23
VW gets separate forums by marque and sub forums by model. The same should apply for Stellantis. Anything else is complicated and confusing and implies too much background knowledge for simpletons like me,2022,3,24
"Most regular car buyers - and let’s hope regular car buyers adopt EVs as quickly as possible - have no idea what Stelantis is, or care a jot. Please make the forum as accessible and welcoming as possible and avoid any approach which requires an explainer. Brand, model, alphabetical and comprehensive.

"Hi there, I have a 500e icon on lease and it was all going good untill a month ago I kept getting a onscreen warning saying something is wrong with the passenger airbag and the SOS assistance.

My 12v battery is leaking so pretty sure this is the issue,2022,12,3
"That's pretty poor. It suggests there's a manufacturing defect and should qualify for a warranty replacement. They should also sort out any damage to the paintwork if the leak extends that far. 
Also, request a courtesy car so you are not left without transport.",2022,12,3

"So we got our first EV, a 30kW Leaf, in 2017. In 2020 we replaced it with a Zoe ZE50 R135 Rapid charge. 
 
It used to be that you could travel along the motorway with no particular issues, if one charger was broken, you'd go to the next one. 
 
But, travelling from Bristol to Ipswich today has taken 8 hours. 
 
These days it seems, with many more people in EVs, there just aren't enough chargers, every one we reached had a queue of people, and if you stay at the services more than 2 hours they want £15. Half the chargers on the M4 are broken it seems. 
 
It's literally at the point of making me think we need a Petrol car again, just for long journeys, because the lack of charging infrastructure makes long EV journeys a massive hassle and really stressful. 
 
Anyone having similar experiences?",2021,10,24
Absolutely 😁👍,2021,10,26

It would only be exceptionally long trips ie from South to say Scotland that a charge would be needed. I suspect that even petrol owners would start with a full tank before long journeys. Stopping at MSA's with high fuel prices is probably avoided as much as possible. So it begs the question who are those who are using MSA fuel stops, are they all ultra long journeys or just bad planners.",2021,10,26
"There appear to be 4,919 rapid chargers in the UK, and 20% of miles driven are motorways. There are 158 msa, but including a number of good off motorway chargers, 200. 
This gives an average of 5 chargers to each msa for an equal supply, as there are between 1-3 chargers typically, there is a deficit of 3 chargers to each msa on current provision.",2021,10,26
"I am proud to say that I blocked 8 CCS bays of 175kW chargers today, parked up in front of them, for 6 hours, with a diesel van. 
 
That is probably the most >50kW chargers (excepting Tesla) I have ever seen in one place, to date. And I have seen a few. 
 
They were not yet powered up, so don't start throwing the vegetables at me just yet.   Very impressive, TBH. Looking all in place and ready to be switched on ... probably waiting for either a new electrical supply and/or some greenwash MP to be available to cut the tape and get the credit. 
 
They were at the Shell station southbound A34, 2km just down from the M40 J9. Not a big service area, short entry curve, drive too fast and you'll miss it. Bays nicely placed on the far side of the hardstanding. 
 
Well, I don't know how many we will need, still looks like a h3ll of a lot to me, and we seem to be coming up with similar numbers now, really. Of course, they can be phased in over the next 20 years, because we're not going to hit 100% BEV fleet any time soon.

"I live with my folks (don't kill me we're all happy with it) and yeah a driveway (and any kind of EV even a bargain basement 22kwh ZOE) is something I could otherwise not dream of. It's only because the older ZOE and battery lease exist, and I jumped in before the used prices got silly, that any EV was really in my reach even in such a privileged position. On the plus side, I dived in almost 4 years ago and the car itself is seemingly worth more than when I bought it. So I've only had to pay battery lease and extended warranty into it (plus the required expensive services) and otherwise owned a car for 4 years for nowt.

If an 'average' usage is 25 charges per year,then that sort of network, properly distributed (some sites will need more than 10, some less) is capable to deliver to a 400,000 EV fleet. Of course, there will be peak and off-peak times, but this is just to size-up the whole idea. ""  
 
Well, we DO now have ~400k cars and we do NOT have 10 chargers per location (though Tesla is shouldering its own load for its own BEVs), so this thread subject should come as no surprise to anyone if they had read my 6 year old post..... ",2021,10,27

"As I said in an earlier post, many here are assuming that the current technology of EV charging will be identical to what we'll be using 10 years from now. And it won't be. We already have the Ioniq 5 and the EV 6 that can charge 80% of their batteries in 18 minutes. It won't stop there. Charging at C4 or C5 rates will likely be common in 10 years and just as likely batteries will sustain that rate until the full 100%. Let's not forget about higher ranges being more common as well. 300 miles is probably going to be standard. Sizing of the charging network will look a whole lot different when we all drive cars that can leave the home / street and go for a full 250 miles at motorway speed, and will then be able to fill up again in 12 minutes, rather than us driving cars that can go for 150 miles and need 45 minutes to reach 80% again.",2021,10,27

"The problem with increasing battery capacity is that we don't want to increase volume, weight, cost or consumption of precious mineral resources. Newer battery designs improve all of those, but we still have to strike a balance between making batteries bigger (in all the above senses) and providing more chargers on the road systems. You can't solve either problem by assuming limitless resources for the other.",2021,10,28
"Every increasing battery capacities are (mostly) not the answer. Much better to have more efficient cars and reliable ultra-rapid charging. 3 hours or 200 miles at motorway speeds between breaks would be plenty if you can add another 150 miles in 20 minutes while driver and occupants take a comfort break and grab some refreshments. 
 
Very large batteries where full capacity is only used once in a blue moon are not an efficient use of resources. Charging these batteries on 50kW chargers can block that charger for a long time causing delays to other potential users. Nobody needs to occupy a rapid for more than an hour.",2021,10,28

They won’t be too bothered when they stop and can’t get a charge, but will use and pay for charging if it is available. (Discuss). 
Whereas big BEVs aka 4 wheel drive sheds will just pixs people off by parking over 2 spaces and hog the charger for too long. 
Bigger batteries can generally charge faster in kW but unfortunately they are in big sheds that do few miles per kWh. 
Lots of generalisations, but I’m mourning the loss of the days when there were only Leafs and Zoen and it looked like BEVs would be less damaging than ICE. 
Big BEVs are just greenwash.",2021,10,28

"The National Travel Survey shows that the average car journey lasts 22 minutes. And the average distance travelled for each journey is 9 miles. Whilst MSAs do need more rapids, surely it's a massive increase in destination chargers that needed rather than 720 rapids at each MSA. 
 
 2018 National Travel Survey Factsheets (publishing.service.gov.uk)",2021,10,28
"Yeah, for me having chargers at the places I go would massively reduce the need to ever rapid charge. 
Especially in the leaf, a typical day out with the family might involve an hour's drive somewhere. Given its tiny battery, it almost always then needs charged to get home again. 
Better destination charging would make owning smaller battery cars far less hassle, which is surely a good thing. People don't want to have to stop and charge for half an hour on the way home from a day out, when the journey length is only an hour. 
As a result we've ordered a car with a huge battery instead.",2021,10,29
"There seems to be a real lack of maintenance with chargers too. So many are broken or only serve up a fraction of their advertised power.

The moving parts thing is a complete red herring, the world is moving to EVs because of carbon dioxide emissions. If you could make a ICE which ran on a zero carbon fuel which was better than an EV, then we'd be sticking with the ICE and all its extra moving parts.",2021,10,29

The Fiat 500e used they cost almost nothing .. I see many low mileage under 9000 USD. 
 
Any idea how expensive could be to import one in EU ? 
Any issue with registration of the car .. I guess register it in poland can't be so complicated, I see multiple for sale in the local market over the last months",2017,2,15
"When I checked a few years ago for the UK it was about £1300 port-to-port ro-ro. The car must be drivable. Otherwise you'd need to use a container which is much more expensive.  
 
Door-to-port added a lot to the price. It will be cheaper if you can find someone to drive the car to the port. Flying there and driving it to the port  might  be cheaper but don't forget insurance. It is easier for me because I'm a US citizen and kept special ""touring insurance"" that covers me driving in the US for short periods of time.  
 
Also most car dealers won't know how to handle export paperwork. You may end up having to pay California sales tax and and DMV fees even though the car isn't staying there. 
 
 
In the UK we have to pay 20% VAT and import duty within 14 days of the car arriving at the port. After that we have to get vehicle approval (IVA) before the car can be registered for on-road use. 
 
I'm sure Poland will be somewhat different. You need to check.",2017,2,15

"Hi all, 
 
So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e! 
 
It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it 
 
I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car! 
 
Thanks!",2022,3,26
Id go Fiat 500e or ID.3 if the back seats aren't big enough.,2022,3,26

The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO. 
 
Even setting that aside, I'd imagine that manoeuvring a reluctant child into, and out of, a child seat will be a recipe for back trouble!

"I'm 5'10"" & although we only use the back with our 2.5y old granddaughter in a child seat I did try an experiment soon after my wife got the 500e... 
 
 I sat in the passenger seat and moved it forward until my knees were very close to the glovebox but not touching. 
 I then moved to the back and although my legs needed to be splayed I could have managed a short journey of 10-15 minutes OK. 
 The drivers seat remained in its normal position (wife's seating) and was actually further forward than the passenger seat throughout so I'm pretty confident that this would be OK for school runs with kids as described.

"Summary 
 
 Audi confirms two new pure electric cars will enter production. 
 First up is the R8 eTron super-sportscar, to be unveiled in January 2015. 
 Far more important is the 300-mile range EV family car, set to start production in calendar year 2017. 
 Audi looks serious about competing with Tesla. 
 Volkswagen makes ten million cars per year, and has huge procurement scale and manufacturing efficiency advantages. 
 http://m.seekingalpha.com/article/2...300-mile-range-ev-plans-to-compete-with-tesla",2014,11,22
It's nice to see the pick up of all types of EV's,2014,11,22
"Are they going to compete with the MS or the III? 
 
If it is the III, they may get out of the gate ahead of Tesla.",2014,11,23
"I've been harping on about EVs for a long long time and since well before the Nissan Leaf. People were well used to me going on about 'crazy stupid' ideas and seeing me in wacky cars. It's good to see that EVs now are well and truly here to stay and that the development of EVs is most certainly main stream. Much the same as with petrol/diesel cars it takes a while before things become affordable but the pace there is also quite staggering too. It took a lot longer for the Austin 7 to arrive on the scene. 
 
Oh and by the way I am very much a petrol head and always will be but I am also very very much committed to EVs too. It's good to see BMW and Audi in the EV market, surely everyone knows that all the salesmen in the country will now be demanding they have one on their drive as a company car and the rest of the sheep will follow. ",2014,11,23
"I'm inclined to agree with the ""halo effect"" or whatever marketing speak you want to call it. When I look around the (any) office car park it is easy to pick out the cars belonging to different types of people. e.g. at the extreme there are people who will laugh at Skoda, Seat and even VW but believe their Audi is a world-beating vehicle. Others who still crow about BMW being the ""ultimate driving machine"", a marketing campaign for which I have seen the internal slides - the car companies know exactly what their target market is and how to play it.  
 
Much as Elon Musk funded the Model S with the roadster (and lots of loans), you can fund a lot of research by marketing to ""status-anxious"" people. They'll happily pay £20000 on top of a normal car in order to have the nominal capability of reaching 60 mph two seconds earlier. They'll even give up three seats, a boot and a roof for it. Just look at the limited run ""Type R"" type cars where people pay  more  money for a car which is missing the rear seats, air conditioning, radio ... 
 
So making an electric R8, at £40000 more than the petrol one, is a nice little earner. No effort required to make it faster either - that comes naturally. 
 
You are quite right that the 300 mile family car is more important for the 95% of us who don't consider our car to represent our status. But we may as well make money out of the 5% to bring the cost down for the rest of us and feed them whatever rubbish it takes (including the increase in performance arising from not fitting a radio!)",2014,11,23
"What I would be interested to know about is the process that made Audi switch from chickening out on the electric A2 (which as a diesel A2 driver I am still mourning) to a point where they are aspiring to leadership status in the premium EV market. What happened to change their minds? Whatever it was they are now followers, not leaders.",2014,11,23
"Tesla happened. They proved people will pay a premium for a nice looking high performing car electric car. Not as many people will pay that premium for a Leaf, or Focus EV, Jazz EV etc. the electric A2 would have been a compliance car, same as the 500e. It probably wouldn't have even gone on sale here. With the R8 they will get excited journalists, excited fanbois, and the same revenue as they would from the A2 project, and the same CARB credits. Audi can probably even charge more for the R8 than Tesla can, because Audi is a known trusted brand with existing dealers.  
 
It's good news as far as I'm concerned, because it means the plugin variants of the A4, A6, Q5 etc will not be far behind, and electrifying those cars even a little bit has a huge impact on net emissions.",2014,11,23
"500e got a lot of excited and journos, much to Fiat's dismay it would seem.   
 
Oh, and back on topic, an A1 e-tron would be lovely please.",2014,11,23
"It's worth remembering that in the ICE world, margins are much higher on moderately expensive cars (top end models of more popular ranges) than those in the mass market, so it becomes easier for your first model using a new expensive tech to be in that price bracket, because it becomes easier to price it against equivalent ICEs and not take quite so much of a bath on the business case. If I was Tesla I would be worried about an A7 e-Tron eating into my Model III funding mechanism.",2014,11,23
"No real evidence that Audi are going to do anything mainstream - could all be just vapourware. 300 miles NEDC for the family car so probably 200 miles real world range or less if it ever gets launched. Pricing unknown. 
 
Interesting that the article is written by someone who is short Tesla shares.",2014,11,23
"Better late than never, but I'll believe it when I see it. The wife's Q7 is due for changing in April and Audi more than any mainstream manufacturer has, through being late out of the blocks absolutely nothing to offer me or interest me. Actually scratch that, neither has Jaguar Land Rover.",2014,11,23
"from autoblog today; 
 
It's no secret that Audi respects  Tesla , and  there have been hints  that The House of Quattro is ready to really flex its progress-through-technology muscles in Tesla's direction. Audi will be applying lessons learned in the development of the coming  R8 E-tron  to the future electric car, after it  managed to double the range  of the electric sports car thanks to new battery technology to 450 kilometers, or 281 miles. 
 
This puts another tentative all-electric Audi in the mix and another Tesla competitor, after rumors of  a possible electric Q8  from February of this year. If an electric  Q8  does happen, it's expected to be a challenger to the  Tesla Model X . And that might not be all:  Bloomberg  reported in June  that Audi had ""devised blueprints for several high-performance electric saloons and sport-utility vehicles.""

"Hello all, 
 
I am the very happy owner of a zippy Fiat 500e, my first EV, wonderful to commute and drop the kids off at school 5 min away. 
 
I settled on keeping my good old and reliable ICE Dodge minivan to pull our motorcycle trailer for week end outings. It really is oversized for this usage and I was thinking of replacing it with a RAV4 EV with a hitch. 
 
But... range and range reduction with the additional constraint of the (relatively light) trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it. I would be lucky to get a total of 60 real miles (guestimate) total for the full equipage, which really puts us right under what is needed to go to the nearest track and back... 
 
But, pulling a trailer means that I can add things onto it, like... extra batteries for the Rav4 EV and may be get to a point where, even with the extra weight, I could extend the range sufficienty for our escapades. 
 
Before getting into efficient frontier calculations (I wil need to research the data first), I wonder if anyone here has experience with adding extra batteries to their EV.    
 
Looking forward to learning. 
 
Thank you, 
E",2017,9,11

My wife bought a Fiat 500e last June and I have to say it is a fantastic car. However, one question I have is.... Fiat claims the car's WLTP range is good for 199 miles but when fully charged the dash says the range is 161 miles! Is there some sort of safety margin here?  
 
This has been like this for some time - so when the weather was warmer. 
 
I wonder if any of you can shed some light on this? 
 
Cheers  
 
Austin",2022,1,18
"'They all do that sir' . Mine is the same and seems all owners experience the same. WLTP figures are just like the claimed MPG in ICE cars - calculated based on a specific test which is not like the real world. But it is very odd that everyone has range of 161 miles at 100% Soc, suggesting the software has adjusted it. Very read some people saw 190 range when they first purchased the car, I don't recall seeing that personally.",2022,1,18

"At the end of the day, the “range showing” is a guess by the car, . 
 
What is the ACTUAL range you are experiencing, eg charge fully and drive it",2022,1,18
"I've posted this before, but it is an illustration as to just how different the true range of all cars, no matter what fuel they use, is from the advertised range. In 2005 I bought a Toyota Prius hybrid, and decided to monitor its performance to see how much more efficient it was when compared to other cars I'd owned. 
 
That car is advertised as having a (extra-urban) range of 668 miles (from the official mpg and the fuel tank capacity). That is a complete joke, the very best I ever managed to get out of it was a range of only 607 miles, and in winter that range dropped massively to only 506 miles. 
 
The thing lost over 160 miles of its advertised range in winter. My wife's Yaris was actually worse, that didn't get as close as the Prius to meeting its advertised range. You will find it's exactly the same for ever other car every sold - the specs never come close to reality. 
 
The issue with EVs is that the range is stated in the WLTP testing, rather than the mpg (which has to be divided into the usable fuel tank capacity to get the range). This means that reviews and advertising for ICE vehicles rarely ever mentions the range. As another example, the first few cars I owned were all Minis. The fuel tank held around 5 gallons and they might manage to get 40mpg if driven carefully. That meant that they had a maximum range of no more than about 200 miles, and in reality the range was a fair bit less than that most of the time.",2022,1,18
"It's a known fault with the car discussed on the Facebook car owners forum at some length.  
 
As others said you'll know or learn to understand the cars range in certain conditions using certain climate controls.  
 
I still think the i3 is the best at guessing compared to the Nissan and 500e",2022,1,18
"The indicated range is a fiction. The max range is essentially the usable battery capacity multiplied by the car’s supposed efficiency. So if you can achieve 4 miles/kWh and have a 42kWh battery with 37.3kWh usable, then the range is 149 miles. 
 
4 miles/kWh is pretty good this time of year and you probably won’t manage that. 3.5 is more realistic, so the range is then 130. 
 
to get 199 miles from 37.3 kWh usable means hitting over 5 miles/kWh which is… optimistic. Then again it’s a city car by design so in summer, with very careful driving, you might manage it. 
 
More realistic is just 4.3miles/kWh which gives you the 161 range. 
 
The more I think about it, have they massively cocked up and stated the car’s range based on the full battery capacity rather than the usable capacity?",2022,1,18
"You need a purpose built EV with a slippery outside shape like a model 3 to exceed 4 miles/kWh in winter. Our e208 is giving about 3.3 m/kWh now and it has a 45kW battery. So 199 miles is fantasy from a 37kW battery. Most we have had in the summer is 170 miles of actual driving (150 motorway plus 20 left at journeys end). Which brings me to my second point, you don't drive the car from full to empty. You probably start with 80% or so and end up with 10 to 15% so your range is already reduced.",2022,1,19
"In many EVs, range in cold weather can be maximised if the cabin and battery are pre-conditioned before departure whilst the car is still connected to an EVSE. As stated above, damp roads and the use of heating; lighting and wipers are a constant battery drain. Cold weather range reduction of 25% is not uncommon in some wet and cold wintry conditions. I have also had days when the GOM range has dropped quickly post departure, only to stabilise and increase as cabin temperature stabilises.",2022,1,19

Has anyone enquired? I know 6 years ago my install cost me £249 after the grant. I assume it'll be far more today. Also my concern is whilst 'smart' is neat.

"Hi all, 
 
Figured to join the SpeakEV forum for a non-manufacturer specific EV community in my bag of EV places to ""hang."" 
 
As of this writing, I'm a former Active E Electronaut, current i3 reservation holder (still waiting), current Tesla Model S (primary driver) and Tesla Roadster owner (occasional driver (my wife's car)). I can be found on forums as either Dennis or dennis or AEdennis depending on whether someone else has already snatched up Dennis as a handle or on twitter as  dennis_p . 
 
I occasionally blog about my adventures in EV ownership on my  blog, ""My Active E has made me Accidentally Environmental. And Tesla made me a rEVolutionary. ""  
 
I am currently dealing with decreasing CAC values on our CPO Tesla Roadster 1.5 and finally having to decide whether or not to spend the money on an i3 (BMW has finally delivered the car to the port in Southern California) and have my wife garage her Roadster (and hand over the keys to the Model S to her for her normal drive.) 
 
Anyways, that's me... 
 
Dennis",2014,7,31
Gosh that's a bevvy of fine motors right there! Welcome Dennis.,2014,7,31
"Hi  @Dennis  and welcome to Speak EV.   That garage makes you sound like the Jay Leno of EV-land. Nice.    
 
Seriously though it'll be great to have another member with cross-brand experience here. As you may have read I drive a LEAF by fell in love with electric thanks to the MINI E, and I'm interested in ALL plug in vehicles. 
 
Glad I'm not the freak I thought I was last year.",2014,7,31
"Welcome  @Dennis .  
 
I think it's safe to say your a bit of an EV fan!",2014,7,31
"Weird one with you guys is you actually get a desirable small Italian car we can't get on our side of the pond, the Fiat 500e, which by all accounts sounds terrific.",2014,7,31
"Hi Dennis, and welcome, I don't mean to be rude and it's probably just jealousy of your fine vehicle collection so please don't be offended but doesn't the profligate accumulation of EVs outweigh the environmental benefits ? 
Andy",2014,7,31
That makes sense and if you're gonna collect cars why not make them nice EVs - by the way I had a good look at the I8 BMW at my local dealer today and it's a fine looking machine. They also told me they had sold 20 I3s and 7 I8s already ( in Canterbury ) which is pretty amazing !,2014,7,31
"Just wondering, what made you sign up for the ActiveE trials in the first place?",2014,8,1
"Forgot to add... The HOV privilege for standard hybrids ended and was further restricted to only PHEV and EVs (or Hydrogen or CNG) which was the impetus to looking at CNG, etc. Additionally, I tried to get on the Hydrogen trials with both Honda and Mercedes Benz, but they had restrictions on the city that people lived in to participate in the trial and though I was often in those cities, I did not live in those cities, so they did not allow me to participate.",2014,8,1
"And I thought I was bad, only a single garage but have an Ampera, a VX220, a VX490, an Aprilia Futura RST1000 and the latest addition a Nissan Elgrand 7 seater (soon to be a 4 berth camper).",2014,8,3

"The dealer arranged collection of my car yesterday, and surprise, surprise, they needed to keep it for another day. I didn't have high hopes, but I got a call this afternoon to say that proximity locking is restored. They say that the latest Body Control software recall deliberately disables proximity locking because several people have locked the keys in the car. I'm not sure I believe that though. The menu will have no reference to it, but it has been enabled via OBDII. 
 
Apparently it took so long because Vauxhall kept closing the case before the dealer was able to download the files required.",2023,4,12

"Hi! 
 
I have just collected my Corsa-e this afternoon. Can anyone please kindly tell me what I should do to stop or start charging via e-remote? It charges straight away when I plug the cable.

Many thanks",2023,4,12

Hurray! The green light has changed to blue after being pushed for a few seconds and the digits on my smart meter display don't move at all. Now the app also shows the slider is on the Deferred Charge. It could be it? The white light appears only when the cable is unplugged ,2023,4,12

"@ym7   
 
i probably wouldn't get a leaf. Winter range is poor and it's chademo and the charge speed is poor. Build quality is better but the infotainment etc and interior is like a museum. Also they don't have steering wheel reach adjust until late 2020 so earlier ones can be uncomfortable. 
 
Corsa is ok but let down by poor software and often useless dealers. Still miss the headlights as they are excellent. It is fun to drive too. I checked my old one and it's showing a recall so that's at least the second it's had in only 2 years. Outside warranty I think it could be bothersome as too many owners seem to have had problems. 
 
Zoe ZE50 is more efficient but has poor NCAP safety. I'd check out its failings. if it's just rear passengers and you don't have them then it won't matter. I'd try one. Certain ones have the 5 year warranty not the lesser one. They're a safer buy. There's been some silly cheap ones about.",2023,5,15
Yea been liaising with Dr Chris who has been helpful.,2023,5,16
"Giving some feedback from the other side...we've had our Corsa-e Elite Nav since October 2021 i think it was and, at the risk of sparking an avalanche of issues, its been great to be honest. I love driving it, my wife loves driving it and we use it loads.  
 
It was never bought with the intention of needing to do long journeys as we have a big ICE Insignia estate for that as long trips generally mean dragging along our daughter, the dog who has a crash tested cage in the boot of the Insignia and other stuff so the Corsa wouldnt be big enough anyway. However we have found ourselves doing some longer trips in it as we got more confident in using it which in reality was us getting used to what it can do. Yes you dont get as much in the winter but you just adjust accordingly, that said its not something that really affects us. Its main use is local running round and for that its great. I love the nippiness of it and i suspect we get rid of a lot of the software niggles as we pretty much use CarPlay all the time.  
 
I recently updated the Infotainment which wasnt a great process especially as i tried to do the sat nav as well which it wouldnt so i gave up on that. The app is crap but to be honest i dont really se it much, scheduled preconditioning is set up and just happens now at the times we need to do it and rarely needs changing, the odd adhoc preconditioning i've done ok when i've needed to and i dont check charging these days since my wifes work got more reliable chargers installed which now just work....the fact they are free and we hardly ever charge at home is a big bonus!!",2023,5,16
"I haven't heard from the dealer I bought my Corsa from, but I used this website to see if there was a recall - and there is! No detail, it doesn't even mention the severity. I'll have to call my local dealer to book it in (the dealer I bought from are 400 miles away).",2023,5,16
"And on my Peugeot e208 too, so maybe it's all the many Stellantis vehicles using the same platform? 
 
Or the government website is hardcoded to say ""there is a recall"". Good chance they are right ",2023,5,16
Hardcoded - sorry that was obscure humour ,2023,5,16
"Our 500e has had four software updates since Dec 21. None of which have fixed the cars Error message system telling me the in car entertainment isn't working, when it clearly is working. But I'm OK with that. It's just a mild annoyance.  
The Mokka-e has had one upgrade I believe but it just works OK. Hoping it continues to do so. 
The Fiat App is much better though, you can specify an end to charging by time or level. Can't do that on the Vauxhall App.",2023,5,16
Stellantis recall - Peugeot garage says it's an engine management software update due to risk of stalling.,2023,5,17

""Thank you for contacting Peugeot customer care regarding the recall campaign. 
 
The affected vehicles equipped with air condition compressor, may face powertrain shutdown in case of AC compressor issue, which can lead to a non-starting or stalling engine. To rectify this issue, we will upload a modified ECU software. """,2023,5,17
"Thanks for sharing your experiences! Although a Zoe is quite cheap too, I do really like the look of the Corsa. Two things about the Leaf that I can't seem to shake off is having a very ancient dashboard, especially analog dials, the other thing is the charging speeds seem quite inconvenient.  
 
I just hope the Corsa-e I'm buying is free from any issues! I'll let you know how it goes. Other than all of the issues, I'm really looking forward to the car, especially the headlights which I've heard are amazing!",2023,5,17
That’s what they said. Not sure what they meant,2023,5,17
"I expect what they mean by ""stalling"" is the engine traction error fault, which would stop the car running. I've heard of some cars stopping in live lanes of motor ways (you can't even coast them)",2023,5,18
"I called my local dealer - not the one I bought the car from, as they wanted £5k more - and it's booked in. First available appointment was the 2nd of August. I have 3 long journeys planned before then, two 800 mile round trips, and one 1200 mile round trip. That'll pretty much triple my mileage before it gets fixed. I'm sure it'll be fine!  
 
My van is also subject to the recall, I'm pretty sure it's  all   Stellantis EVs built on the PSA platform (so everything except the Fiat 500e). I have queried it with the company, but at the moment the silence is deafening, perhaps because we're in the process of transitioning our fleet management from a cut-price company which never hit a single target, to an even cheaper one. A few years ago we had our own in house fleet management department, perhaps when this dèbacle ends we'll go back to that.",2023,5,18
"Peugeot customer service is, in some ways anyway, excellent. If you post a query on their website (with your VIN number to prove it's your car) you get an actual phone call the next day, usually from someone who is actually French (to go with the French car theme   ). Sometimes things get lost in translation, and/or you get the feeling that the customer service person only really knows about ICE cars, but hey imagine getting service like that from Facebook or Amazon etc. 
 
Anyway their customer service person explained that they don't know which of their cars have the affected air conditioning compressor (whatever that is). Presumably the 'stalling' only occurs when this component fails, so this sounds like an unlikely event to happen to any one individual if that is reassuring (I've not read anyone mentioning this fault on this site), so it sounds like a rare but risky event. Who wants to be stranded on a motorway with an immovable 1 and a half ton piece of metal.",2023,5,18
"Let’s see if I can get a sensible answer on this forum 😉 
I had the new recall update installed on Tuesday by Vauxhall which only took about 30 minutes. The following day I had the ‘battery charge’ fault come up followed a short while later by the ‘traction battery’ fault. I carried out the ‘disconnect reconnect’ of the 12v positive quick release lead, firmly reconnecting it, and all seems to be ok at the moment (touch wood). I am wondering firstly if as part of the rebooting process after the software update Vauxhall disconnect the 12v lead and thus could have caused the issue and secondly if a dielectric grease applied to the 12v battery terminal may help keep a good electrical contact.",2023,5,19
"Today, I tried to charge at a Tesla charger, but a Renault Megane was taking up two spaces, and two Teslas were waiting, so I tried a pod-point, which was out of service, finally an Osprey, a Leaf was just leaving as I arrived. Hurrah! I was down to 20%, and I can't charge in the caravan I'm staying in. When it reached 80%, the charge stopped - I presumed it was to stop people hogging the charger, but then I saw ""traction system fault"" on the display. It drove OK, with a warning triangle. When I got back to the caravan, I opened the bonnet to see what kind of spanner I might need to disconnect the 12v battery - but found it was quick release! I'm leaving it for 10 minutes, then I'll try to reconnect and hope the error goes away. I'll need to charge at least 3 times tomorrow, on my 400 mile journey home!  
 
The earliest booking I could get for the recall is the 2nd of August, I think this is probably the fault it's being recalled for.",2023,5,20
"I reconnected the battery, the error has gone... But nothing happens when I press the accelerator pedal. It's in Drive, the parking brake automatically releases, so I'm sure it should move, but nothing happens. Same in Reverse, the camera shows up, but the car doesn't move. Any ideas?",2023,5,20
"I tried again, and it's working fine now. I suspect the 12v disconnection fixed it, and I didn't leave enough time before trying to start. Wish me luck on my drive home tomorrow!",2023,5,20
"I'd push to get it in sooner, I first got the fault on 27th February, car was away for a month, got it back and 2 weeks later it happened again. On both occasions it locked in park mode and no amount of 12v disconnect time sorted it. 
 
It's still at the garage for repair with a technical case away to Vauxhall as the garage have no idea what's causing it.  
 
I've had use of my car for 2 weeks since end of Feb 🙄 
 
Vauxhall customer support is abysmal, I've spent most of this time without a hire or courtesy car. I hired a car myself which Vauxhaul agreed to reimburse. Still waiting on the money to appear in my account. 
 
I will never consider another Stellantis car. I accept cars break down sometimes but their support for EV breakdowns is lacking and customer service is the worst I've ever experienced.",2023,5,21
"I got home ok, no more errors, and 4 charges worked perfectly. The first appointment I could get was the 2nd of August, and I don't need the car for work, so there's no point trying to get a sooner appointment - the only way would be to jump the queue, and others might need the car more than I.",2023,5,21

Have they done the the aircon compressor update and it's still broken after that?",2023,5,21
"They said the fault the 1st time was down to a faulty section of wiring loom which they replaced and all seemed well, for 2 weeks. Then the same happened again. 
 
I'm assuming the wiring loom issue has been a symptom rather than the source of the issue. Both times it happened was after having sat at home charging over night. I'm thinking an OBC issue as there's been a few with the 7kw model.",2023,5,21

Told them to cancel it and luckily I can get the guy who does my ice car to mot it this week

Any updates on those who have the latest ECU update/Recall?,2023,6,13
"Not had any letter for a recall but did notice in the app that it states “There is an update available for your vehicle”  
 
Not sure how long it has said that as I’ve had the car a year and never looked at the checker before  
 
Also had the first service this week, strangely the lease company (leaseplan) booked it in at Halfords. No problems with the service, light was reset (along with all my satnav and radio locations!) but the app doesn’t show the service and still says overdue!!! 
 
Should I just delete the vehicle from the app and add it again to see if the service maintenance bit updates?",2023,6,17

"Due to the Corsa really cheesing me off I decide to break the habit of a lifetime and actually test drive a car I was thinking of buying rather than just sitting in it and relying on James & Kate etc reviews. 
 
I expected to be smitten. I wasn't. 
 
The looks are awesome. The stereo is awesome. The concept is awesome. But... 
 
The screens feel too close and the steering wheel doesn't pull out far at all. Seats are very firm. They are well designed and supportive. I was sat too high in the car as well. 
 
The screen mirrors do work really well but if you're a certain age the driver's side one can be just in the area of vision that is in the needs reading glasses distance. I did get used to it but it did make by eyes weird at times. 
 
Ride is also quite firm but it corners flat as anything. Power steering is clever and weights up at higher speeds but it does mean the car sometimes feels weird when you change direction.  
 
Road noise seems quite intrusive in a way I wasn't expecting. It's definitely louder inside than the Corsa. 
 
Turning circle is fantastic. Stereo is so good I almost ignored all the other negatives.  
 
Steering wheel is also kind of sweaty compared to the cheaper feeling Corsa one.  
 
Boot is very shallow which I didn't grasp. I thought it was shallower horizontally but taller (like the Soul EV). It's very shallow in height but a bit longer in depth. I did have the measurements but somehow they didn't translate to my brain.  
 
Range. Hmmm. Did 30 odd miles and it had about 60% battery or so which isn't any good as my usual trip is 55 and all year so it wasn't going to be quite up to it. It was quite efficient at times and once you'd been going for a bit and were bimbling along at 30-40 it did go up quite a bit. Over all was 3.3 miles per kWh on the mixed run. Think the Corsa would have actually done better. With a tiny battery you have to be much more efficient. It needed to have been Kia efficient as I'd reckon one of those would have been about 4 -4.5 miles per kWh doing the same. 
 
One pedal mode is quite good but even on max death the regen feels weaker than I expected. It was weaker feeling than the Corsa which is quite weak. The Leaf had very strong regen in B mode and also with E Pedal. That was neck snapping in comparison. 
 
Other issue was with reversing onto a sloping driveway. It didn't like it. Mine slopes down and it seems to upset quite a few cars. The corsa I just stick in reverse and it creeps in reverse with the brake on happily. I turned off the one pedal in the Honda and it didn't seem to want to creep so you hit the gas, it lurches off you hit the brake and it's at a dead halt so you are making a right hash of a simple thing.  
 
I'm glad a drove one as it's been one of those cars I haven't stopped obsessing over since they came out.",2021,4,25
"Thanks. Saves me trying to convince myself to keep wanting one! 
 
Coould you try the Mini next? ",2021,4,25
Might be worth trying the Fiat 500e too!,2021,4,25
Looking at the Honda Boot and going back to mine has made me realise the Corsa boot is the smallest I could live with. Fiat and Mini boots are both smaller. Mini also seems to not have a heated steering wheel on any trim level or I couldn't find where it was listed.,2021,4,25
"My wife & I felt the same when had test drive last year. Not good enough. I thought the screens poor resolution which was a big disappointment as they dominate the cabin. The drivers screen was much better though.  
poor efficiency and we drove in summer temperatures. 26 degC or so. Got same efficiency as you. Solid feeling and drives well enough but TOO heavy for such a small car which is why efficiency is so poor.  
fantastic turning circle but that is not that much of a selling point overall. No frunk unforgivable in a ground up design EV with a tiny boot! 
And it has just 50kw charging speeds but on release said it was 100 kW capable.  
A colleague pre ordered and owns one. Likes it but purely short distance commuter car. But almost £30k for a short distance commuter car?! Was getting 50-60 mile range this winter. Just not good enough. Same as original Leaf from 2010.  
Lots of YT reviews marvelling at the aquarium on the screens and that you could plug in a kettle In th 3 pin socket. In the real world though, former is a 5 minute wonder/gimmick and the latter much more useful in a bigger batteried EV! With such a minuscule range most owners would be worried about losing even more mileage By plugging in high drain electrical equipment.  
They need to put a slightly bigger battery in it. eg-45kwh to 50kwh and keep the price the same or lower. Will sell better then. Not seen another on the road apart from my colleague’s so I don’t think they have sold that many.",2021,4,25
"I did like the feel of rear wheel drive though. It's much nicer in some ways.  
 
I haven't seen a single one in the wild either. The honda dealer is only a few miles away so I'm surprised I haven't seen more of them pottering about.  
 
The sales person I spoke to was also using one and doing 60 mile return trip with 50 left regularly he said. Mostly dual carriageway as well so I did think it might have been ok.  
 
It was a lot better mannered at 70 than I expected. If they do a mk2 with a bit bigger battery capacity and better sound insulation I might be interested. It's still the sort of car you look back at when you lock it.  
 
I think Tesla Bjorn did a 75 mph test in warm weather and it was 75 miles range I think. Car wow got 110 I think to flat as a fart. Corsa did about 170 so there's quite the jump.",2021,4,25
"If I were to put together a Jay Leno style car collection, but limited to EVs obviously, it’s a car I’d buy. It would have to be green, or maybe white, but it’s a car I love looking at. 
 
I saw a green one on the A1 a few weeks back, made me slow down and have a god look at it. 
 
As a practical daily driver for me though, wouldn’t work, but still an interesting car in its own right.",2021,4,25
It's the sort of car I'd park in a big garage to look at along with a few other classic old cars.,2021,4,25
"I've seen one in the wild - somebody in one of the villages near me has one. I'm very regular get stuck behind it on the country roads. I'm not a fast driver by any stretch of the imagination, but this is something else. I don't know where exactly the problem lies, but my guess is either nervous driver (which the locals tend not to be), car that's crap on twisty roads, or driver that's worried about having enough range to get home...",2021,4,25
"An interesting write up thank you, those LCD mirrors are a bit of a bone of contention within the industry (or were) as all the testing we did fall heavily in your “I need reading glasses” category, it was great for younger engineers but to those of a certain age they were a pain......and this was back in the 90’s, there is no technology that can make the screen appear further away to the brain/eyes and thus sharp. 
 
The same is happening presently with a lot of Land Rover/Range Rover drivers who have the Clearsight RVM complaining of the same issue, but at least the CS RVM can be used as a conventional mirror. 
 
I love the look of the Honda, forward design which shouts EV.",2021,4,25
Camera viewfinders have dioptre adjustment. You'd need that on the wing mirror screen but I have no idea how on earth you could do it. I think some of the electronic viewfinders also have dioptre some how.,2021,4,25
"@srichards  So it makes you appreciate your Corsa-e a bit more now, huh ?   
 
I'm not saying the Corsa-e is prefect, but IMO it's a good all-rounder... fairly practical if you don't need the extra space in the rear/boot. 
 
I think the Corsa-e's ergonomics are also OK. I can't see myself getting used to something like a Tesla or even an ID.3 with all those touch sensitive buttons and sliders. And I do consider myself a tech geek. 
 
I really don't understand Honda's intentions when they created the E. It just goes to show you that so much tech won't make up for a non-practical car. 
It's nice as a concept car, but really shouldn't have made it to production.",2021,4,25
"It makes me appreciate I shouldn't tolerate the pathetic excuses from Vauxhall for sub standard software as all the functions on the Honda work properly. Bluetooth reconnects correctly. It starts instantly. It was released in a pandemic as well. Blind spot function also seems to work like it should. 
 
Honda has buttons and knobs for quite a few things so it's definitely functionally ok. Heated wheel button is on the heated steering wheel like the Corsa not in some random corner like a lot of other cars.",2021,4,25
"I really like the look of the Honda e, but not driven it yet so this is very useful thanks. Trying to decide what 2nd car to get for the household.",2021,4,26
As a short range second car it'd be ideal really. Especially if it's mostly city driving as the one pedal feature is quite good. You don't even use the brake. It just holds itself when you stop and then off you go again as soon as the traffic moves. It's definitely a better feeling one pedal system than the Leaf one. That's quite soft to go and harsh to stop. The Honda is more uniform but regen isn't as strong.,2021,4,26
The Honda E was great but the Jazz was £8k cheaper and actually has better level 2 autonomy/safety tech (check the NCAP videos) due to a wider angle camera.,2021,4,26
"Interesting read, I'm getting to the point where I need to start thinking about what to replace my lease BMW i3 with in November (lead times etc!) and the Honda E just came back on my radar for some reason. Always loved the design but the range put me off, wanted to go for the Ioniq 5 but availability and no-doubt stratospheric price is ruling that out! 
 
Sadly this thread has convinced me it's probably a non-starter, it's the closest car to the now-ancient i3 really in terms of concept but at 150kg heavier, slower with less power and smaller battery - by the looks of it less efficient to boot! It just seems a real shame they chose the small battery route, doesn't seem to offer the great weight saving the idea was based on, was hoping they'd have been working on a slightly larger version but can't find anything imminent. I could just about live with the even smaller boot but there seem far too many compromises overall, an i3S is currently far cheaper to lease and probably still one of the better small options. Bummer. 
 
*Edit - one other factor with these small battery cars I'm not sure is considered enough - lifespan, Li-ion batteries degrade with number of cycles and when you have to top up twice as often on something like the Honda E vs similar sized Zoe you're likely to experience even more depleted range after a few years, killing used prices too!",2021,6,4
Another i3 is probably the answer  @Jimrod  The electric Corsa is being discounted like mad. It's worth a try but it's not a finished car by any means.,2021,6,4
"Hi, 
With 100% battery remaining mileage is 200miles. When driving in eco and max speed of 60 miles per hour after a drive of 60 miles, battery indicates 50% with remaining mileage of 60 miles. With this indication we never dare to go beyond 120 miles on a full battery. Do you experience the same? And how do you handle? 
Thanks",2022,11,27
"Stellantis GOM is a but silly. When full it's very optimistic and when you start using running the battery down it become very pessimistic 😂 
 
If it works the same as the Corsa when you start running it down it calculates the higher end of the red bar as 0%. In reality that's 12.5%. So probably add another 20 miles on. Obvs depends on style of driving/weather etc. 
 
Don't get too hung up with the GOM, it's a guess, just a very poor one in Stellantis vehicles. Better to look at your consumption and do some quick maths based on 45kwh useable capacity.",2022,11,27
"Look ignore the GOM. For every 10% of battery you need to be doing about 20 miles. If your doing that or get a consumption of 4.4 then your bang on 200 miles.  
 
The other day with no effort on my part and at 65 to 75mph I did 75miles at a consumption of 41% which is a 182 mile range. I stress that was with zero effort and 9deg c outside. I could have easily done far better but I wanted it warm and comfy and didn't need to bother about extending the range.  
I admit being a novice owner concerned by range but after 14 months of ownership I have absolute confidence in my Mokka-e and am thoroughly enjoying driving and owning it.",2022,11,27
Sadly not.,2022,11,27
"My Vivaro (same EV hardware as your Mokka, and in fact all Stellantis EVs, except the Fiat 500e which was designed by FCA before the merger) says 140 miles in summer, 132 right now at about 5C with a full charge. That's always wrong - in summer I can get 2.1 miles per Kwh, for a range of 95 miles. Right now, it's more like 1.8, so 81. Others in the company report it can go as little as 60 miles (I've only had it a few months, so haven't driven it in midwinter yet).  
 
It's heavily loaded with ladders on the roof ruining the aerodynamics, and even with 5 months of data it doesn't learn.  
 
Stellantis EVs are known to suffer worse than any other EVs in winter, though later versions have a revised final drive and heatpump which ought to improve the range by as much as 10%.  
 
The EV Database gives a more realistic estimate of the range - as low as 110 miles!  Vauxhall Mokka-e",2022,11,27
"@Senti79  I had the same experience. The car itself is amazing, it's quieter and smoother than it should be for such a small car when driving at higher speeds, but when driving at 60mph and upwards, I would find that it could do between 100-120 miles on a full charge and the remaining charge on the battery would go down very quickly with each mile. Rather disappointing.  
 
Driving in the city, I could get up to 240 miles. It's a real shame the efficiency is so bad at higher speeds, it's the main reason why I got rid of it after 3 months.",2022,11,27
"Unfortunately it's the cold weather.. Our claimed Mokka range has tanked the past couple of weeks, it was showing 50% - 52 miles earlier today.",2022,11,27
If i'm going on a longer trip in our Corsa-e i will reset one of the trip computers before setting off and then you can get a better rough idea of what you can expect to get by doing some quick maths of the miles per kw you are getting multiplied by 47 which most seem to suggest is the usable number of the battery. So for example if you are doing 3.3 miles per kw you could expect to be around 155 miles from the full battery. Its not fool proof but gives you an idea.,2022,11,28
"Yes i was shocked when i drove it to the airport on the M3 the other day i was driving at 70 -75 and less than a 100 mile range ridiculous i had to charge 3 time as i got anxious over range. I think the lease company will be getting a call to return it, shame really as around town range is ok and its a comfortable car.",2023,2,6
Well there's your problem. 70 to 75 just gobbles power. 65 is about the sweet spot for speed/ power consumption. Consumption increases exponentially I believe.,2023,2,6

Anyone who has picked up their new cars, how is the app and software ? This is usually the main issue with new EVs (see ID.3)

From in the car, you can set 3 schedules for charging and climate, and it seems independently set the charge rate in 5 stages. I'll look at charging tomorrow since I have weekend off-peak.",2021,7,30
"We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related. 
 
There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful. 
 
The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h 
 
With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds. 
 
The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode. 
 
This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem. 
 
I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing. 
 
Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it.",2021,8,3
"Collected my La Prima 3 weeks ago. It had recall Software updates installed prior to delivery, which delayed collection. I am still familiarising myself, but car is going back in hopefully for Nav update and others as Traffic Information and Tyre Pressures do not show. I can't be sure everything else is working at this stage. As to battery percentage and range , I wonder whether previous driving styles/modes are taken into consideration in the calculation of range. 
 
Great car and opted for the electric sunroof, which is great to have.",2021,8,3
"Still made zero progress with setting up connected services, I'm hoping this will give better battery management since coming from teslafi where every drive is logged on a website the data available is a bit light. We're finding the start/stop button a bit odd. Surely it shouldn't be necessary to turn the car off before locking it? But then the lights/radio stay on and charging timers are ignored. 
 
Its very clear that 'EV' options are an afterthought in the radio software. No way to 'charge now' if schedules are set (and who won't have scheduled charging if they have a dual rate tariff?), and most of the display cards seem fairly inaccurate. I've not managed to get a sensible watt hour/mile display, 0.3 kWh/M mile really isn't accurate enough.",2021,8,9

 When the charging cable is inserted and there are no charging schedules selected, the cable will be locked and the immediate charging procedure will begin. LED (B) fig. 212 and LEDs (B) fig. 211 will light up green flashing/fixed depending on the state of charge of the battery portion indicated by the LED. The fixed green light indicates that the battery portion is fully charged.

"Hello! 
 
First time poster and EV owner here. My better half has just gotten her license (auto only) and decided to opt for the Fiat 500e 24kW. 
 
We currently rent our home and may be looking to move in the next year or so. Ideally, we’d like a home charging solution since the range on the 24kW 500e isn’t the greatest and I don’t want to be sat in our local station car park every day! 
 
Having a gander online I can see things like PodPoint’s are around £700 but with the £350 grant this will obviously work out cheaper. However, I’m reluctant to pay for a charger that I’ll own and add value to a house that’s not “mine”, only to move in 8 months time and have to fork out for a new charger again, this time without the grant (since it’ll have been used). 
 
So, I know that  Egg  isn’t the cheapest solution as it’s £30 a month not including the exorbitant cost of electricity at the moment and I understand owning our charger would be a cheaper option long term BUT given our current circumstances described above, does this seem like a decent short term option or is there something better I should be looking at? 
 
Apologies if this is a noob question, this is our first foray into EV’s and so I’d rather ask people with knowledge than try to figure it all out on my own with no idea what I’m doing. 
 
Thanks in advance, 
Goose! 🙂",2022,6,5
"The unanswered question is how far will the fiat travel each day? 
It may work out better to Rapid charge it every now and then when needed until you have the new place.

 Get a quote for a fitted charger 
 get a quote for a commando socket (likely cheaper. Do you get a granny cable with the Fiat?)

 estimate range and how often you’d need to charge on a rapid and how much that’d co 
  
work out which is cheaper - but bear in mind even if one option is a little more expensive it may also be more convenient to you. Also check the T&Cs for the subscription as you might have a minimum period and worst case they may uninstall if you cancel, which you should also check the landlord would be ok with  
 
If you can really get a charger installed for £700 that’d be my preference. Two years of rental of egg it’d already be more expensive.",2022,6,6
"I’ve seen Egg advertised online, looks like a simple short-term option, lots of flexibility, or for those who find the up-front cost of having a charger installed a tough proposition.",2022,6,6
"Charger installation grants now ended so you will be paying full price. Do you have off road parking? Will the landlord agree to amendments to the electrics there? If asked, some landlords will actually fit a wallbox themselves, using a different grant system, and then increase the rent slightly to cover that extra facility. Sometimes using a local public Rapid charger is a far cheaper option in short term situations. Especially if daily mileage is relatively low and only requires a 20-minute visit a couple of times a week. And can be combined with a shopping trip or gym visit for instance. There may even be a streetside slow charger nearby where the car could be parked overnight and a short walk involved. At no installation cost, just slightly more expensive electricity. 
 
A cheap home option is to use a 3 pin 15 amp portable charger - commonly called the granny charger - but as that is really for emergency use it is not recommended for various reasons. Try the forum 'search community' to investigate many threads on this subject. But loads of people have used one exclusively for years. Some have encountered worrying problems though. But as long as the house electrical system is sound, and care is taken, this could solve your problem economically for a short time.",2022,6,6

"Disclaimer: I'm posting an almost identical post on the Kia Niro forum, so apologies if you've already seen this. 
 
Brand new to this forum, but proud owner of a 2013 Fiat 500e and the unfortunate, current lessee of an ICE vehicle. I am currently living in Texas (happened to find the Fiat 500e at the local CarMax in 2016 with only 8000 miles on it!), which makes my EV enthusiasm a bit difficult to say the least. My lease is ending soon and my rabbit-hole of a search for an EV to replace my current car has led me to two finalists, the 2019 Kia Niro EV and the 2019 Hyundai Kona EV. I've been in touch with Hyundai and Kia dealerships and done quite a bit of research on these vehicles, but am struggling to really differentiate these cars from one another. 
 
The 2019 Kia Niro EV  is  expected to be delivered to select Texas Kia dealerships in early 2019, as per my conversations with several dealerships. The 2019 Hyundai Kona EV, on the other hand, was not going to show up in Texas at all...and multiple dealerships had told me that I would not even be able to order one to be delivered, so I figured my decision was made for me. 
 
BUT THEN 
 
I saw this article:  Hyundai Will Satisfy U.S. Hunger For Kona Electric  that says that, although California and other ZEV states will be the only states that receive deliveries of the car, Hyundai will ship the 2019 Kona EV to dealers in non-ZEV states if there is a ""sold order"" in place. 
 
So it looks like I have a choice again. I'm ultimately planning on test-driving both vehicles (out of town weddings are a good a time for a test-drive as any, right?), but wanted to see if there was anything else any of you had heard, seen, read, experienced that would lead you to recommend one vehicle over the other? 
 
Thanks in advance, appreciate the help!",2018,11,15

I am currently living in Texas (happened to find the Fiat 500e at the local CarMax in 2016 with only 8000 miles on it!), which makes my EV enthusiasm a bit difficult to say the least. My lease is ending soon and my rabbit-hole of a search for an EV to replace my current car has led me to two finalists, the 2019 Kia Niro EV and the 2019 Hyundai Kona EV. I've been in touch with Hyundai and Kia dealerships and done quite a bit of research on these vehicles, but am struggling to really differentiate these cars from one another. 
 
The 2019 Kia Niro EV  is  expected to be delivered to select Texas Kia dealerships in early 2019, as per my conversations with several dealerships. The 2019 Hyundai Kona EV, on the other hand, was not going to show up in Texas at all...and multiple dealerships had told me that I would not even be able to order one to be delivered, so I figured my decision was made for me. 
 
BUT THEN 
 
I saw this article:  Hyundai Will Satisfy U.S. Hunger For Kona Electric  that says that, although California and other ZEV states will be the only states that receive deliveries of the car, Hyundai will ship the 2019 Kona EV to dealers in non-ZEV states if there is a ""sold order"" in place. 
 
So it looks like I have a choice again. I'm ultimately planning on test-driving both vehicles (out of town weddings are a good a time for a test-drive as any, right?), but wanted to see if there was anything else any of you had heard, seen, read, experienced that would lead you to recommend one vehicle over the other? 
 
Thanks in advance, appreciate the help!",2018,11,15
Type Tesla Bjørn into YouTube and you can see a whole series of reviews on each of the cars you are interested in!,2018,11,15
"Is space or interior quality an issue for you? If not, then maybe the Kona may be better (don't get me wrong, it is still a great car). The Niro will probably be more expensive and harder to get, with demand",2018,11,15
"As above, see Bjorn videos and other YouTube Paris motor show reports to get a better view of actual vehicles. For me... I like the Kona looks, the HUD, the steering wheel, dislike the centre console area and the stuck up media display and want the extra space in rear and boot. The  Kia  steering wheel looks naff (but I could live with it), I like the centre console so much more, Media display is nicely embedded in dash and has the space also, but then its more money. Would really like to drive compare the two side by side to decide, but that's not possible. Attended Jaguar I-pace.. art of performance event at Millbrook Proving Ground, Bedfordshire today and blown away at the performance of this vehicle. Stunning! Also got to drive all other Jaguar models so able to do comparisons.  Hyundai  or Kia are likely ev solutions for us though and since Kona is now 9months wait, e-Niro looks better option. There is little to choose between the two (they are sister companies, so powertrain is identical) other than styling and space differences. You might get better miles/kWh from Kona as its slightly lighter and this test scenario shows that case, but I would take it with a pinch of salt as all these tests are not what you might achieve in reality.

"We have covered the differences in detail in the kia e-niro uk interest group, but they of course apply to the UK. The fundamentals are space, interior design, looks apply globally. Niro way best for families. Our poll in the group clearly shows that the UK edition e-Niro is missing 3 key features: LED lights, Rear Cross Traffic, Blind Spot detection in comparison to the Kona UK top version. The Niro is also limited to some dull colour options compared to Kona. Other features such as rear USB, sunroof missing for UK.",2019,1,19
"In the UK, I'd pick the Kona premium SE for features, colour choices, sporty handling, and the way it looks.. unless I needed the space, in which case I'd take the Niro despite its looks being a little bland, with poor colour choices and lesser specifications.",2019,1,19

"Moien, 
 
I'm Änder from Luxembourg, aged 44 and last week I ordered a Fiat 500e Cabrio after having felt to get an electric car for a certain time now. The Fiat will be my main car, replacing my 2015 Renault Mégane Coupé-Cabriolet with a Diesel engine and more than 100k km on the counter. 
 
I like to go on hikes in my country, especially the Auto-Pédestres. Their name comes from driving with a car to the starting point and then walking marked circuits, there are about 200 of those in my tiny country. 
Seeing whole forest parcels dying these last years, I thought I better switch from burning oil products to electric power, which can be produced in a much cleaner way after all. 
 
I hope I'll find the answers I'm looking for here and maybe make some interesting contacts.",2022,7,27

"I put the following here: 
Today has been the first day I drove an electric car, for about three hours in the morning. 
It was a test drive with a model similar to the one I've ordered, basically just in another colour. Took it from the Fiat garage in Bertrange to Echternach and back. Drove it in the city, on narrow country roads, a wide national road and a motorway. 
So far I'm marvelled by the 500e. I tried out the Range and the Sherpa modes to which I got used almost instantely. On the wide national road and the motorway I tested the nearly autonomous drive, which to my surprise works extremely well. 
Nice plus: My girlfriend likes the car too. 
 
I also tried out how charging works on a fast charger. Charged 5kWh, which took about 5 minutes and cost less than 2.50€ (the battery was around 55% when I plugged in the cable).",2022,8,22

As some of you might know, I've just picked up my Renault Zoe ZE50 GT Line CCS from ELMO DRIVE today and, as I believe there is no one on the forum that uses their services yet, thought we could all have a place for opinions, questions, share feedback etc.

Lets hope the experience is as easy and smooth as it has been so far!",2021,1,4

Turo works well for hiring with a few days notice as there is a bit of to and fro with the owner. The keyless entry with Karshare is great for both parties but I wonder what the damage inspection at pick up and drop off is like - could be open to abuse / arguments.",2021,2,18

Obviously a lot would depend on the timing. How far in advance do you need to commit to the days? And can you back out if plans change. Maybe you have to rehire your own car?!

"Dort had 500e 3 months now and energy in is working out at 3.12 kWh/mile but costs low combined with a few free PodPoints and overnight tariff works out at 1.8p/mile so overall PCP and running costs favour EV over a new petrol Fiat 500.

2) Rental includes insurance (£1000 excess though in fault claims) up to 1000 miles. month, tax and all maintenance costs 
3) you do not get a key, you use an app to lock and unlock the car. 
4) You can pick cars up and drop them off and ""depots"" around the country. 
 
You can use a referral code (see below   ) to get £50 off your first month. 
 
My experiences so far.  
 
I phoned on Wednesday and asked for a 120 i3. No problems at all; arranged pickup the next day from Windsor 
 
Took the train to Windsor only to realise it is a 4 mile trip to the pickup point, I stupidly decided to walk. The pickup point is not obvious and is actually someone's house (the cars are all parked in a big yard) There were at least 3 i3s and a few Zoes there as well. 
 
Once I find the car (the reg is on the app) it connect to the app via bluetooth and a button unlocks the car. The car was brand new and still had the plastic seat covers on so I was pleasantly surprised (note there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.) 
 
The only hitch was that the 3 pin cable to charge the car is in the front boot and the button on the app did not seem to work. I phoned them and it is a known problem that they are working on (hint to EVEZY, if this is an issue don't put the charging cable in the boot!) Fortunately I RTFM and found the emergency release wire in the cabin so used that to open and move the cable into the back boot. 
 
Car is great, there is a dash-cam but you soon forget about that, otherwise it is just like a normal i3. When I got home I was able to activate the BMW connected app and set preconditioning times etc so that all works like a normal car.  
 
Overall I am very impressed, the lease is cheaper than most other places and far more flexible, it also includes insurance so that is another saving. My only concern is the app but it is working fine so far. I have only had to enter the password once but do now carry my reading glasses everywhere I go! 
 
My referral code is in my sig. I know others have codes as well so feel free to contribute and people can pick a code at random!

They're relatively new, but by a few months rather than a few days. They went live some time over early summer (2 units). I'll try again tomorrow maybe activating first before plugging in or something, but so far they don't appear to work with the card.",2020,12,26

"Hi all, 
 
Just a quick write up on my recent experiences with Onto. I received a Zoe ZE40 around 2nd April which I kept until 11th August when I swapped for a ZE50. The old car was picked up and was apparently going straight to auction. On 15th September I received notification that I was going to be charged for damage to the car (to the tune of nearly £500 for four items), I replied back the same day disputing two of the items. I eventually received a reply back on 9th November (about 8 weeks after my email). The email essentially said the items I queried were 'outside of the BVRLA Guidelines' so that was that. One of them was for an alloy repair, I have tried to query what I've actually been charged for but no one has been able to tell me. Here is the photo:",2020,12,30

I swapped to Elmo and since then all good so far. I’m living in fear expecting Onto’s damage invoice email tho. 5-6 weeks ago the into ZE40 was returned and haven’t heard back from them (at all) yet.,2020,12,30
"It's a shame that IF they had cars available that they couldn't shift at their Depots, that people who want to temporarily suspend for a month or two can't just pay a nominal fee (to cover insurance) and have the cars sat on the driveways, but immobilised by  on.to. Then when you want to restart it's a quick call and payment and off you go. 
 
I mean I can see why they wouldn't, but if they had an abundance of vehicles it would save them (and subscribers) so much hassle. 
 
 
On the subject of contact I emailed them a few weeks ago about something... and nothing. That was my final deciding push to go with Elmo instead.",2021,1,7

Earn 1 Point per £1 you spend with Onto, which can be spent on Additional Driver, Damage Excess, Mileage Packages or Car Swap (but not Delivery/Collection or EU Driving). 100 Points = £2 off one of these products. After six months of Subscription you get an extra 2500 Points. 
 
 
So for a ZE40 at £339, you're looking at gaining £6(ish) a month to spend on these products, if my maths is correct.

Still waiting to see if we get any charges, but I would hope not given it got resprayed after an accident a week before... 
 
Moving to a lease because we're fairly committed to needing a car, and once you get into larger, longer range vehicles Onto starts to get pretty expensive. I still think it's a great deal for many vehicles, and the Shell card is huge news. No brainer if you want lack of commitment but have the income to afford the car and are happy to spend it.

First impressions of the Kona are good. The interior is nicer than expected, although the overall quality is (as is to be expected) not quite up to the standards of the i3. It will definitely be more suitable overall for our journey profile - it’s nice to be back in a car with an 'auto-pilot' system. 
 
Fairly sure it won’t be as much fun to drive when not on a motorway, but more comfortable for sure.

Hey guys! Great news again",2021,1,20
"Hi team. New member here very much playing catch up and spent a bunch of time reading through Onto's discussion forum over the weekend (only to have just found this one! 🙈 - I won't pretend to have read more than about a hundred of the >6600 posts in this thread) 
 
I live in London with my fiancé and in a normal world we get by without a car no worries. We usually hire whenever we need and haven't taken a lot of domestic trips in the past (I'm an Aussie expat having lived here for almost 4 years now). I'm also a zipcar member (free tier) which was helpful, but the state of the shared fleet varies wildly and I do worry about catching something nasty from someone.  
 
With COVID impacting international travel, I'm anticipating that we'll want to explore much more of the UK this year, or at least for the 3-6 months after this lockdown eases. The idea of catching mass transit at the moment really doesn't appeal -- TLDR I want to get us some wheels for at least a few months this year, probably from ~April or maybe May.  
 
I've been getting bombarded with ads online for Onto recently, and quite like the proposition, but I wanted to check before I signed up if my logic was sound--  
 
Is it something I can sign up to and then commit to / request a vehicle in advance? (e.g. start in mid April or May?) Is it better to wait until later on to apply? (I assume there's some kind of approval/account review, but no idea how long that takes). When you sign up, are you able to opt to defer taking delivery/pickup of a vehicle? (Right now we're both WFH so have no real need for a vehicle in this lockdown)  
 
I've done a whole bunch of reading and think I have my heart set on the e-208 (prob the GT-- though now that it's the 'new GT' not sure if that still make sense?). I have read the range is a bit rubbish, but aside from experiencing the Zipcar eGolf I've got no clue what real world impact it'll have. I live about a 10min walk / 5min drive from 4x BP 150W chargers and now that Shell's in the picture think the charging network looks pretty decent.  
 
The other thing I'd plan to do would be to get excess reduction insurance -- I already have a rental car excess policy through 'insurance4carhire' which I had for rental vehicles separately, from what I've read that seems to cover Onto as well?  
 
I'd really appreciate any tips, thought or advice (hopefully flame free!). I feel like I spent half my weekend planning virtual routes with zap-map and reading up on charging, dreaming about drives through the country or to the coast and being free from the bounds of where my legs or bicycle can take me!",2021,2,1
"Your plan looks pretty good to me. They also have a good helpchat thing on their website so you could try that.

Even the entertainment interface gets easy to use after a few months!",2021,2,1

"@tyson  I've also just a few weeks ago had a successful insurance claim with Innsurance4carhire excess cover (£40 ish per year). 
Someone reversed into my OnTo Tesla M3 SR+ parked outside my house, I had all the camera footage with clear number plate etc. Looked like a straightforward claim in my favour, but it still fell thru (presume they weren't insured or something). Didn't get my £1k excess back from OnTo (invoice was £1700). So claimed thru I4CH and got paid my £1k excess within a few days. 
Just about to renew my I4CH 12 month excess cover policy and I think it's now about £46 for another 12 months. Definitely worth keeping an eye on these threads, I can't thank the core 'group' enough for the heads up on recommendations like this.",2021,2,1

It’s probably easier to provide great customer service every time to everyone when you are are just a fledgling company with a very small customer base.

"This relates to an ONTO supplied e208 Allure Premium. 
 
Had the car nearly one week and have done 1,000+ miles in that time. ODO now just over 3,000 miles. Car registered 30th April 2022. 
 
Driving long distance yesterday the screen became unresponsive and refused to allow any heating. Despite several stops including charging where the car was switched off & locked - the fault remained, meaning I arrived home cold! There must be a reset somewhere but I'm not familiar of such. 
 
The android auto works one day, one journey, not the next. Its totally unpredictable, dropping my connection & my Google maps mid motorway when needed due to traffic jams requiring a new route.  
Never had a problem connecting with any other car. 
 
There are many things that irritate me about this car, having toggle switches that are not back-lit yet everything else is beyond a joke at night, especially in heavy rain.. 
 
No auto hold seems a big miss.. 
 
Having to rely on an app to charge during cheap rate hours at home...  
A start time but no finish time..., why not a simple interface built into the infotainment system.. 
 
Its a lovely car to drive but I have no faith in the infotainment system. Its pants IMHO  
 
Anyone have any suggestions regarding resetting the system?  
 
Many thanks",2022,9,28
"I think the only way to force a reboot on the infotainment is to either hold the manual power button in for ages or disconnect the 12v battery for a short while which forces everything to restart. 
 
Check the version number as there might be an update. I'd still moan at Onto though as you need to be able to work basic functions.",2022,9,28
"To add..., I just 'started' the Pug to put in my garage and the toggle switches became back-lit...., glitchy by name.. 
 
Bizarre issue with a phone call today where I could answer with the appropriate button on screen but not the phone button on the steering wheel.. 
 
Glitch..  
 
Can't wait for my new e-wheels to arrive so i can send this one back...",2022,9,28
Definitely sounds a ropey one.,2022,9,28
"My Vivaro has the exact same EV stuff as all the other Stellantis EVs (except the Fiat 500e, which was designed by Fiat Chrysler before the merger). It was quite flaky, Apple CarPlay was temperamental, and a couple of times the screen went black.  
 
Then I updated the software, and the issues went away. It's fine now. Be warned, it takes a very long time, and you'll need a computer not just a phone. About 90 minutes to download, 5 hours to transfer to a USB stick, and a couple more hours to install. It's worth it though.",2022,9,28

"At the launch of the Fiat EV 500e, there was much made of the Pedestrian warning noise that it makes a very low speed. The eC4 does not have such a warning noise, I may have misread somewhere, but I thought this was law. Looking at Fiat‘s launch video they spend ages and compared with other EV’s warning tones. Can anyone enlighten me. Thanks",2021,11,30
"New noise systems to stop ‘silent’ electric cars and improve safety  
 
Frankly it wasn't the UK that lead on this, but .... 
 
Cars before this time had optional VESS with some not being fitted with any and others having off switches (that toggled back to on when the car was switched Off and On again) to turn them off. It used to be illegal for cars to make reversing noises, but now its allowed. 
 
I would assume that your C4 complies with the new law and hence makes noise up to 20 MPH which you cannot turn off. It is possible if the C4 gained type approval before the 2019 date that even ones produced today are silent. Have you tried asking someone else to drive past you at a slow speed in your car? With the LEAF you can barely hear the noise in the cabin unless you open the widows and drive past a reflective object like a brick wall.",2021,11,30
"Frankly, I’ve never heard mine either. 
As far as the manual is concerned, it should have one!",2021,11,30
"A lot of cars legally don't have to because they were certificated before June 2019 and registered before June 2021. But, I assume that yours was registered after June this year so it should. There is talk of it being made part of the MoT Test but that hasn't happened yet, but I'd suggest checking again and then going to your dealer.",2021,11,30
Test driven one last week and had no noise as far i could hear inside the cabin,2021,11,30
I'm trying to get this clarified by Nissan as my Leaf makes no sound reversing - barely audible going forward. Since July 2019 it certainly seems to be obligatory as safety feature - as this  gov.uk advice says.,2021,11,30
"The Leafs don't have a reversing noise and the ped warning is so quiet that I struggled to hear anything but a feint whine. (which I thought was the motor) 
 
My Golf is the same, and switching it off or on produces no audible change inside unless the windows are open.",2021,11,30
"I suspect that when MOT comes due for post July 2019 EVs it will become a widespread problem. As a safety requirement, like lights, horn etc, pedestrian sound will have to comply to pass. As far as I can see, it is not currently part of the test, but 3 years from July 2019 cars registered from when they were supposed to have a sound system will need an MOT. 
It's pretty poor on the part of manufacturers & dealers appear to be either ignorant or unwilling to be honest about the potential problem it may create.",2021,11,30

"Hi  
My 500e lease is up in about 18m and I was wondering what could replace it? Max length in my garage about 3.8m the 500e being what 3.2m? Looking for a small city car with a similar range (160 real miles 199 wltp).  
It's that length on the Fiat side as there's a freezer. Other side has my Mokka-e.  
 
So I was thinking eUp or another 500e. Anything else I ought to be considering? Like I said 160m range and max 3.8m long. 
Thanks",2023,6,18

"A Pug 208e would also probably be too long, around 4055mm",2023,6,18
Yeah thought about and rejected due range...and cost. Though I'll be leasing so it's less of an issue.,2023,6,18
"Mini electric I think is too slow, too long and not enough range. Bit disappointing really for an expensive little beast. It is nice to look at though 😅 
 
Edit: - just read a review or two, take back those comments above. Seems it's not too bad on range for it battery size, around 150 miles-ish and 7.3 0-62 so its fine. I'm just being cruel. At 3850mm it might just fit in front of the OP's freezer too.",2023,6,18
OK now that's a possibility. I can pop into Chelmsford there's a mini dealer there and get a test drive. Not for me but for my wife. At least its a bit less 'Barbie car' (so that's a good thing.) Cheers,2023,6,18

"This is the only reason I don't currently have an EV. My specifications are pretty much the same as you but I have the additional requirement of at least 100kw rapid charging (I dont just use my car around town, so need a couple rapids a month on longer trips, but length is the issue in my parking spot). 
 
Once I find something I'm jumping on it, as yet, nothing. I am guiltily enjoying my stop gap at the moment though (300miles on a 'charge', fits perfectly, sub £100 a month) but it's not perfect (petrol, manual...).",2023,6,19

"Having driven the eGolf for a short while recently (don't ask) I was mightily impressed, it felt like a nippy Golf without the noise, was lovely. Having gazed longingly from afar at the Fiat 500e. Having been bewitched by my time driving the MINI E all those years ago. Having spent far too many hours of my life sprinting down country lanes and nipping across roundabouts I have to wonder... 
 
Where's our hot hatch battery electric vehicle? 
 
Surely this could/should/would be one of the key ice-breakers in terms of EV adoption. Get people in a small(ish) EV with good performance and decent range... but most importantly compact and quick, and I'm sure you'll win ever more hearts and minds. 
 
Am I mad in thinking this is a market that could really, really benefit from BEVs? I mean they already claim them as city cars, the hot hatch is only one step beyond that surely?",2014,9,2

Don't count on it; it's a City car. It has hot hatch 0-60 already. The limitations for hot status will be the height (CoG) and skinny tyres.,2014,9,2
"The i3 underpinnings could work surely, even the LEAF. I don't know why someone wont take that risk if it's a repackaging case. The GTE and others like it are a good thing, I imagine that's going to be a beast, but for those unconvinced by electric drive it could possibly re-enforce that battery alone just isn't good enough... and surely it is, if someone is bold enough.",2014,9,2
"I haven't driven one but my understanding is the i3 is hot hatch quick, isn't ?",2014,9,2
"Close in terms of 0-60, but not really quite there, it also doesn't have any of the traditional/accepted ""hot hatch"" appearance or style traits really.",2014,9,2
"0-62 has to be sub seven these days I reckon to be a ""true"" hot hatch. 
 
That also does rather look like a small family hatch back with a weird paint job imho.   Like the look of the wheels mind you.",2014,9,2
"i only ever saw the golf as a hot hatch. but it was not very quick most hot hatch can't get sub seven, like the Honda civic typeR 200bhp 7.1 0-62, Renault clio 172/182/ 7.1sec the Renault clio 197. 7sec dead. but my evo4 (4.6) sec 0-62 474bhp oh how i miss that car but not the fuel bill lol",2014,9,2

Would fit on a scifi set though, and why not, who says cars have to be ""car shaped"", we should get over that.

"We got our first EV - a 2014 BMW i3 (trading in my 2008 535xi estate) six years ago. We swapped that out for a Chevrolet Bolt in 2017 with my wife selling her ICE 18 months in an attempt to become a one-car family. Have made numerous 1000 mile+ trips in the Bolt - totally up to the task. Given our schedules, the one-car plan only lasted a few weeks until I noticed a used bright orange 2013 Fiat 500e selling for only $5000 so picked that up as our local runabout. Pre lockdown we spent quite a bit of time with our family in the UK and hoping to be able to do that again next year (fingers crossed).",2020,11,19

Technically still not a patch on the Voltec system, and virtually identical battery capacity to the Volt Mk1! Bolt would do well over here I think, but looks like VW's ID.3 will be filling the long-range-but-cheaper-than-Tesla-and-its-a-hatchback slot. 2013 Fiat 500e seems to be a cracking little car, if you can get hold of one!",2020,11,19

"Anyone got an idea of the average length a customer stays with them? 
 
Must be less than 6 months, surely? It would be insane to pay a premium for the flexibility of short leases, then have a long lease anyway. 
 
The fundamental problem of their business model is nearly everyone needs a car on a time horizon of several years. Only a few want a short term stopgap - planning to emigrate, waiting for a new release, changing jobs... And for those few it's much cheaper, though less convenient, to buy an ageing used car and sell it on after a few months.",2022,3,2

So it comes down to where they will deliver a car. In any case Onto have a fixed fee for delivery and collection.",2022,3,4
My Onto Model 3 was delivered to and registered at a flat I’d moved out of 6 months previously for ease of collection. A week or so after I’d collected the car I just emailed them to say id “moved” to my actual address. They never updated it anyway.,2022,3,4
"Hello all, wondering if you can help me with some advice regarding ONTO or an EV subscription in general. 
 
I'm looking at getting a car in the next few months as I finally have the spare money to do so and I love the idea of having an electric car. 
 
ONTO appeals to me as it's a one month subscription so I'm not tied down (something which scares me after being a freelancer in the past) and comes as one package with insurance and charging etc and doesn't require a huge deposit. 
 
I was looking at a Zoe GT Line but they've recently removed the £450pm option and now only offer one for £500. Now that's not a huge jump but I'm questioning whether it's value for money as I worry I won't be doing anywhere near the mileage required to make it smart. 
 
My biggest issue at the minute is trying to figure out whether I'd be better just getting an ICE car, which would of course be cheaper. My assumption was fuel costs and whatever else would push me close to £500 a month anyway. 
 
In short, is the extra money a month worth not being tied down to a 48 month PCP deal and having to pay a deposit that I don't have? Or is there a cheaper way to get myself on the EV ladder? Any help or advice would be more than welcome, and please assume I am a complete novice in this area!",2022,5,6
Get something cheap on a 3 year PCP and you can give it back for a break even after a few months in the current climate.,2022,5,6
"The ONTO offer seems expensive at the moment, as there has just been a major price increase. There shouldn’t be any further hikes for about a year at least, as ONTO don’t like to review their tariffs more frequently than they need to. No doubt their competitors will need to review their charges in the not too distant future, which should narrow the gap. Whether the maths work really depends on your individual circumstances, and what value you place on flexibility. Obviously if you live in a high risk area, and don’t have any NCB, the included insurance could be worth a lot. If you charge cheaply at home and rarely use public charging, then the BP, InstaVolt and Shell Cards don’t really add any value for you. Other companies such as Cazoo are now offering EV subscriptions, so it seems it’s not a flawed model.",2022,5,7
Note Elmo do offer unlimited BP charging if you pay £10 per month. They should advertise this bit more...,2022,5,7
"PCPs are disposable at pretty much any point. I’ve never had a 3 year one longer than 6 months, and usually had a zero or sub-£1k cost to return.",2022,5,7
"Hopefully someone with an Onto subscription can answer this. 
 
My wife has ordered an Onto vehicle to use until her Polestar arrives in September. She starts a new job in July and has just noticed that on her first day she has to show them her vehicle insurance certificate proving business use. 
 
She works in an office, so no Deliveroo etc. The business use is purely to cover going to her company’s different sites and the occasional meeting at a customer’s site. 
 
Is anyone else in a similar situation, and if so what have you done to make sure you have appropriate insurance cover? 
 
We emailed Onto and asked if they’re ok with going to her company’s other sites, which they are. However, that’s not evidence enough and an insurance certificate is required to prove it. We obviously can’t get that until the vehicle arrives, but then that would be too late if she’s not covered.",2022,6,3
Any comments on what wait times are for ONTO at the moment? The last time I looked year ago nothing was available and I got no notifications for the vehicles I enquired about.,2022,6,5

Delivery or collection will increase from £99.50 to £129.50. 
Swapping a car will increase from £49.50 to £79.50. 
 
That means if you book a delivery, collection or swap before 1st Dec, you will pay the current price, regardless of the delivery date.

"Having checked it's not April 1st and that I'm not dreaming, ONTO have gone crazy with their pricing and charging offering. I get that the world is upside down at the moment, but wow! Up until recently, I had a Kona which I was paying for the extra 1000 miles on as I do about 1750 a month which came in at £759...

 New monthly subscription prices;",2022,12,8
"Crikey, so a Zoe GT Line+ will be £80 a month more than it is with Elmo, for less miles and a higher over-mileage cost? 
 
If Elmo can keep their prices down and can get decent numbers of cars in stock I can’t understand why people would chose Onto. 
 
It'll be interesting to see how Onto display their new prices vs Leasing as it’s already a bit of a farce.",2022,12,9
"Losing BP Pulse and (effectively) instavolt are a huge loss for me.

"ONTO are now trialling a “no charging included” subscription on Tier 1 vehicles in their fleet. This basically means paying £60 a month less to forfeit the Shell Recharge Card. So, if you live in London or the South East, and don’t mind an ONTO branded Fiat 500e, you can hire an EV from as little as £339 a month. There are delivery/collection charges, but these can be reduced somewhat by using a referral code to get £100 off the first months sub.",2023,2,6
"Does anyone know if it will be an issue for Onto or Elmo that I haven´t owned a car in the UK for years as a result of living abroad? I have no claims ever (a clean record from 2008 to when I started driving until 2013), but from about 2013/2014 to present there is going to be nothing in the record at all as a result of not owning a car in the UK at all in that period. i.e. they might see I haven´t had car insurance 
 
When I come back and apply does anyone know if that will be an issue? Has anyone here ever replied with a blank record like that? Looking at the eligibility criteria, it might be OK? 
 
I could just ask them, but I´d rather not draw attention to the issue by asking, I´d rather just apply not mentioning it.",2023,5,9

I chose the exclusive model, didn't think I was a person that would be sold on cheap thrills but my girlfriend and I loved the panoramic sunroof when we test drove one a few weeks ago haha! Blue was the only one they had left so I will be getting that one. Think I prefer the red though. 
 
I drive around 75 miles a day round trip to work almost exclusively on motorway/dual carriageway, so I am interested to see how often I need to charge it. I live in a flat with only on street parking too, hoping to be reliant on work charging. Some days fast chargers aren't available however, so I'm also keen to find out if I can rely on granny charging. As well as trying out the overall EV life and enjoying the ZS experience! I've wanted to convert for ages now. I work in aviation and drive an ICE car so I have no environmental credibilty whatsoever haha. 
 
I will email to ask about the referral code, poor Lucas has had me pestering him a lot!",2021,4,30

"Yes, unfortunately i think you will need to charge every day.  
 
Agreed on the dashboard set up. What were MG thinking when they decided not to put a battery percentage reading anywhere in the car? It can tell me the temp of each tyre to a decimal point but can't tell me what percentage SoC of my battery. Would be comical if not so annoying!",2021,5,5

In my case I mostly use my local council’s 7 and 50kWs (Greater Manchester;  Be.EV) which were free until the end of Sept. I don’t have a charging solution and home and their chargers are at work and in convenient locations for me. This first month having to pay for it for example, I used it for 125kWh (and I was for 1 week in France anyways). These wouldn’t have been covered by those charging solutions included in Onto.

"Greetings! Getting a Leaf tomorrow and looking forward to it. Couple of questions if I may: Anything I should be looking for whilst taking delivery? Also, should I download the NissanConnect Services app? Does it work for a rental?",2022,3,24
"Thank you. I guess the question is, do these apps work for Elmo cars? What happens if a previous driver has registered the VIN with the app and does not unregister or disconnect his/her app from the car?",2022,3,24
"Thank you. Leaf received and looks good. In fact, a little too good, no scratches or scuffs. I'd prefer if it had a few, I wouldn't have to worry too much   The problem now is that NissanConnect does not allow me to register the VIN, as apparently it has already been registered by someone else. I would think that these issues with rentals would have been ironed out by now, but alas. Anyone know how can this be fixed?",2022,3,25
"Thank you. Emailed Elmo yesterday and they said they will pass it on to the fleet team for resolution. Keeping fingers crossed. I had to charge at a public charger today and I went back twice to check the progress, which is a waste of time. Need that app!",2022,3,26
"For anyone considering Elmo for an EV subscription: I am in the 3rd week of renting a Leaf, and while the Elmo people have been fairly responsive in responding to emails and even calling me on the subject, I still don’t have the ability to register the car with the Nissan Connect app, due to a previous renter having registered the car with his/hers and never de-registering. After two weeks they asked me to email Nissan the rental agreement, which I did, but still waiting to hear back. Two issues here: a) The de-registering process should be automatic or part of the handover process. To give the car back you have to show that you have de-registered from the Nissan app. B) People should be courteous and de-registering the car from their Nissan app when they hand it over. I thought EV people are more conscientious than average!",2022,4,6

"Similar issues have been reported by ONTO subscribers. Perhaps it should be part of the return procedure. The driver picking up the vehicle being returned could make sure the subscriber had removed any connected services. This could be backed up with a fine for anyone who failed to do so. Similar to what happens if a vehicle is returned particularly dirty, or has been smoked in.",2022,4,7
"Over a year ago the ELMO guy on here said they were looking at more charging options, then radio silence. Anything in the pipeline?",2022,4,13
"So are you talking about adding other public charging options in addition to BP Pulse? With ONTO we get three cards. I rarely use the BP card now. If Elmo would offer the Shell Card and Instavolt Card, they would be great, even at a reasonable additional charge. Or maybe a deal with Gridserve to have access to the Electric Highway and Forecourts. That would definitely give them an advantage over ONTO.",2022,4,13
"Yes, just BP pulse isn’t great. They are most standalone chargers rather than any of the big motorway services banks of chargers. 
 
Gridserve would be great as it differentiates from the  on.to offering. We already pay a fee for public charging as opposed to included with  on.to. 
Its a shame the online presence here from Elmo disappeared.",2022,4,13
The elmo charging offer is so inferior to the  On.To one. BP pulse means searching out individual chargers (risking in use/out of service/ICEd) rather than using a convenient bank of Instavolt or Ionity on my commute.,2022,4,13
"An update on the registration with Nissan Connect. Nissan customer services reached out to me a couple of days ago saying that the system is now updated and I can register the VIN with the Nissan Connect app. So it now works, finally. All in all, the Elmo team followed up with Nissan frequently, the Nissan customer service people were pretty quick to respond. I think the failure is in the process. An electric car subscription service is not about providing the vehicle. The app is a major part of the user experience. So, the de-registration and registration activities should be part of the handover process. In the handover checklist, together with checks for scuffs and dents, there should be a check on de-registering the car from the app. This will save the next customer’s time, the Elmo team’s time and Nissan team’s time.",2022,4,14
"If Elmo do eventually offer more charging providers I’d like to see them as optional from one another.  
 
Hear me out. 
 
I think it’s fairly obvious that any additional charging providers would be an extra cost. Currently BP access is £10 a month. Say Elmo add Shell and it bumps the price up to £20. 
 
I’d like to see them as separate. I would continue paying £10 for BP and wouldn’t take up the £10 Shell card, as in the past sixteen months I have only used Shell-included chargers at less than £10 a go, so financially it doesn’t make sense for me to pay £10 a month (extra) for something I don’t use.",2022,4,14
"So the ZE50 from Elmo arrived. 
Dark grey and being slightly newer than the model my PCP is finishing on it has AEBS. 
No winter pack but shouldn't need that fortunately. 
 
Handover was ""interesting"". Chap was lovely and I think he was just trying to be helpful but I didn't really need a tour of the car given I was stood next to my bright blue ZE50. 
 
So initial issues; can't pair the app. Car is reporting data as disconnected, app says there are no contracts(!). Elmo looking into it.

"A couple of changes I've not noticed before. 
 
You can now choose between Morning and Afternoon delivery - used to be ""it'll turn up at some point"". 
 
You can pay £15 a month for Excess Waiver (reduced excess) - but I can't see this as an option when trying to book a car, nor what it reduces the £1000 excess down to. 
 
 
There's a 25p/mile charge if you're over your mileage allowance. Wording seems to say you can average no more than 1500 miles per month. 
 
 
Delivery is now £119... 
 
 ""Delivery. A flat delivery fee of £119 is applicable for drivers in England and Wales. Cars delivered to Scotland will pay an extra delivery fee.""  Also seems to be the same price for Collection. 
 
...BUT it looks like they've removed the £95 Admin Fee at the start of a new Subscription. More expensive for me based on the old model, but much cheaper for anyone who lives more than 75 miles from their Depot in Oxfordshire (which was 50 miles free, then £1.20 per mile after that). 
 
However, this is where it hugely differs. I live (just) within 50 miles from their depot, so my delivery and collection and under the old rules were free (but I had to pay the £95 admin fee). Now, it is £119 each way - which for me would be an increase (Collection plus Delivery) of £143. I wonder if I'll have to pay the £119 Collection Fee when my current car goes back...",2022,9,27
"That's some interesting changes, I have an MG5 being delivered on Friday and I give the Polestar back.  
Not seen any of these changes, may have to go back and look at my contract. At least for the mileage changes, as that's always been a pain with Onto before.",2022,9,27
"I have just gone back through my contract and it is 35p+VAT per mile overage charge up to 1500, 50p+VAT for 1500 - 2000 and £1+VAT for anything above 2000. Originally delivery and collection fees still apply. 
 
I definitely went over my allowance in the Polestar, luckily I had it confirmed at 10p previously. Suppose I will just need to be a bit more cautious on the miles! 
 
We are going down to a 1-car household in the next couple months, so only a short-term concern.",2022,9,28

"Onto and Elmo are probably on par now with the changes they have put in recently. It is just going to come down to personal circumstances what works best, so things like mileage per month, charging networks near you/on your commute, do you have a home-charger, what car do you like! 
 
Elmo have better CS in my opinion, much more open to sorting problems, although as said above, they have lost their edge since the cinch buyout.  
 
If you do more than 800 miles per month regularly, or have a long trip within your hire period, Elmo are ahead as they change mileage based on your entire hire time, rather than month to month with Onto which is painful.

ElmoSave ties you in to a lower monthly for a minimum of 12 months, ElmoFlex is higher monthly cost, but minimum of 60 days (then 30 days notice after that). 
 
 
Examples: 
Fiat 500e La Prima 42kWh is £449 a month on ElmoSave, or £499 on ElmoFlex. 
Renault Zoe GT Line+ EV50 (Rapid) 52kWh is £422 a month on ElmoSave or £469 on ElmoFlex. 
Tesla Model Y is £1169 (Save) or £1299 (Flex) a month - that's a huge saving all things considered.

"Do EV’s need a start button? Tesla for example don’t use one. Is it just a legacy item going back to ICE days?  
 
Why not design all EV’s without the start button and save on hardware and unneeded additional steps?  
What value does the start button actually add? If all EV’s just switched to ready mode when all security was met - e.g. key detected, foot on brake, wouldn’t that be far easier? 
It would also mean that the issues of running down the 12v by not engaging the HV pack would not happen. Perhaps I’m missing something but it seems like the start button is just a familiar item as is the auxiliary function, but it all seems a bit dated now.",2022,2,10
Yes - good point. You don’t necessarily need a start/stop button to reboot in the event of an issue though - again Tesla use the steering wheel buttons if you do need to reboot. 🙂,2022,2,10
"I found the start button lets you change menu settings that you can only do with the car switched on. In my id.3 I pressed the start button without pressing the brake pedal to continue downloading a software update while sat in the car. 
 
I am sure there must be other things you can change only with the car switch on.",2022,2,10
"Over a drive, having a start/stop button on our Zoe adds one key press compared to our Tesla. You have to press the start button before you can engage drive. When you stop, I always press the park button on the Tesla, on the end of the right stalk, which moves to park mode and engages the parking brake. Pressing the stop button on the Zoe does the same thing, so no more actions there. 
 
On the Zoe, pressing and holding the Start button, without a foot on the brake, turns on continuous auxiliary 12v power, which is a useful capability. You have to go into a menu on the Tesla to do that. 
 
Personally, I'd like more buttons and stalks on the Tesla. The single touch screen is liveable with, but the ergonomics are not as good as a well laid out dash with physical controls in my opinion. You can't find the virtual buttons on a touch screen by touch only / muscle memory. No wiper stalk ... bah.",2022,2,10
That’s interesting. I’m not familiar with the iD3. Can’t you just switch the car to ready mode and do all those things? Why do you need to switch on without touching the brake?,2022,2,10
"It's an interesting point. My wife hated the way the Tesla just started up without doing anything, and hated the column switch just as much. When looking for an EV for her she was adamant that she wanted both a start/stop button and a ""proper"" gear lever. The latter I tend to agree with, even after nearly a year the push button drive/reverse/park buttons on the I-Pace seem slightly awkward - a small selector lever would have been more intuitive, I think. Certainly the selector in her Zoe seems more intuitive to use, but some of that may be because I drove a succession of Prius's over a decade or so, that had a similar sort of selector..",2022,2,10

"Does the tyre-inflator that runs off the 12V aux socket have a flex long enough to reach all 4 of the tyres on an ID.3? Please do check & let us know! If too short, that's a potential safety-failure of VW, and the inflator should go back to them to have a longer flex fitted imho.",2022,2,12

However I recently have driven the south road from Cladich to Ford and on to Ardern a couple of times in the Leaf and it was very pleasant. Smooth, always in the correct gear (as there is only the one!) and effortless, with the 1pedal mode avoiding the need to use the brakes.

Going gently and maybe 20-25 miles of range down. The following downhill section recovers around 10 miles of range before levelling out for the final 3 miles. 
 
All good then, just going quite slowly is fine. Getting the charging point installed next week. Looks like I can do comfortably 2 round trips on around a 80% charge without worrying about it.

"Stellantis cars let you set a start time. That's it, no end time, no max charge. It's bonkers, but it is what it is. The only way is to set times using your EVSE - all new ones are required to be smart. 
 
Same for all the electric Vauxhalls, Opels, Peoguets, Citroëns, DSs, and Fiat and Toyota vans (the Fiat 500e car might be different - it was designed by Fiat Chrysler before the FCA/PSA merger that formed Stellantis, all the others were designed by PSA).",2022,8,27
I too have the 5 hour window. Yes presently the app has no stop time or charge level settings. But it's a Stellantis product. So is the Fiat 500e ( which I also own) and the Fiat app has both. So it's possible that Stellantis may add these features. But presently the only option is to set your alarm for 5 am and unplug it.,2022,8,27
"If you had a podpoint installed as part of the car deal then just set the podpoint schedule such that each day it will charge from say 9AM to whatever time you want it to stop charging in the middle of the night.

"We use our newly installed Zappi v2 to set a much more defined period of charge. Zappi can start the charge at midnight and ends as we have set, 5 hours later. You can set schedules Monday to Friday and the weekends. The key thing is the charger itself allows you to set how many hours and minutes it charges for. 
 
Sadly we can't do it from our Peugeot e2008 in the same way.",2022,8,27
"Some folk have reported issues where using a start schedule on the EVSE results in the car not being in a state to accept the charge but one would assume you allow the EVSE to charge a little earlier but set the car to start charging at the time you want with the charge being halted by the schedule on the EVSE. 
Personally, I just plug it in and charge so have not had any of these difficulties except when using an Ohme that tried to defer my charge for an unfathomable reason and somewhat confused the car. 
 
Many people have reported issues where they use both a schedule on the EVSE and the car schedule and find the car isn't charging as they expected but I can only imagine they get it the wrong way round unless the car is doing something rather odd. 
 
For a number of Corsa and Mokka owners a recent update appears to have caused deferred charging problems which hopefully will get fixed soon.

"It strikes me that the manufacturers should be made to provide certain features as a standard in all cars. Mercedes’ has no ability to set the charge start or stop time for example although you can set the SOC % so can limit excessive use of full rate that way if it suits your needs. Here there is no requirement for the charge units to be ”smart” either so mine is just a plug and play with no inbuilt control of stop or start times. 
I would have thought trying to get everyone to use the cheap rate is in any country’s interests (maybe why the U.K. insist of smart home charge units 🤷‍♀️). One can only hope here the EU starts pressuring the manufacturers.",2022,8,27

"Had to the bite the bullet and go full EV as the Zoe is getting a bit too wheezy to be relied on to do 24,000 miles per year! That's too high a mileage to be able to keep the car for a long time, so we decided to add a second EV so that it shares the load. Second car usage is currently much lower, so the combined mileage is 30,000 and the shared load will be 15,000 per year, which hopefully the Zoe will cope with. 
 
Decided the Soul was our best option in terms of £/kWh of battery, as we needed the best range we could afford since we are giving up the ICEV range comfort blanket. 
 
Found a nice 10 month old top-spec Soul, should get it by end of Feb all being well. Have to say it's massively solid feeling car, bit like a big Jeep. Aiming to keep it for 7 years or so, so having 6 years of warranty is a good feeling too.",2023,2,20

"I think people forget that VW have been producing electric cars whilst all the announcements have been shaping up. 
 
In November 2018, they sold over 3000 e-Golfs alone across Europe, which is still more than Hyundai’s Kona and Ioniq, Kia Niro and Soul put together? 
 
YTD as of last November, VW had made and sold over 18,000 e-Golfs in Europe, only behind the Leaf, Zoe, i3 (mostly Hybrids) and the Outlander. 
 
If you want to accuse VW of dragging their heels around BEV production, then you should really be questioning anybody other than Nissan and Renault too. 
 
It helps to have a few facts at hand if you're going to attempt to put the boot in I think. I know some people don’t like VW, and that’s fine, but some of the criticism is not only incorrect but irrational.

"Morning all. New e-208 owner joining the discussion.  
 
For the last few years we've adopted a x1 ICE and x1 BEV vehicle strategy. We now use the ICE (VW campervan) for longer trips, weekends away etc, and the BEV (Tesla Model 3 initially then most recently a Model Y) for most day to day and local driving, which accounts for 80% of our driving. We did use the Tesla for longer journeys (south Wales to Scotland or France as examples) but more recently have found charging wait times and subsequent longer journey times to be a regular annoyance. Hence why we default, for now, to the ICE for longer trips. That should be better in a few years when the charging infrastructure has caught up. 
 
We concluded last week that as a result we didn't need a Tesla to cover mostly local day to day driving for the next few years. So, on something of an impulse, we decided to swap it for a smaller, less expensive BEV with lower range. The e-208 won, picked one up a few days ago. £24k for a e-208 GT in Elixir Red. Registered Jan 2023 and with only 300 miles on the clock. So, basically a new car for a considerable discount off list. Further research tells me this is one of those 2022 models (range 225 miles) being cleared before the arrival of the refreshed version with slightly more power/range. Suits us perfectly though. 
 
First impressions are very positive indeed! 
 
Things I like more than the Tesla experience: 
 
 The e-208 looks lovely, nicely designed inside and out. 
 The drive in the e-208 is more refined. Much better suspension. And quieter. 
 More comfortable seats. 
 Apple Carplay is available. 
 Digital cockpit - good to have dials in front of me again. 
 Some buttons for simple controls. 
 Auto wipers work. 
 Door handles (inside and out) that I don't have to explain to people how they work. 
 A glovebox I can open without navigating a touchscreen (OK the glovebox is tiny  ) 
 Being back in a small hatchback is nice, much more town and car park friendly. 
 Insurance is less than half the price of insuring the Tesla 
  
A few things that the Tesla wins on: 
 
 Range, obviously, it was a Model Y Long Range that could comfortably do 250 miles. 
 Ability to set a maximum state of charge, I used to set the Tesla at 80% max when charging overnight. Quite surprised I can't do that on the Peugeot. 
 Speed. Even the LR has ridiculous acceleration. I'm no boy racer though so can take it or leave it. 
 App just worked. Less steps to get it connected to the car and just leave it. Mobile as car key also good. 
 Heated seats. Didn't get them on the e-208, I gather they are an additional option. 
 Dog mode in the Tesla was regularly used. 
 Storage space, Model Y is obviously much bigger. But the e-208 boot is big enough for our spaniel so fine. 
 Frunk to carry charging cables 
  
Overall, very happy with the change, always had a liking for little French hatchbacks and the e-208 seems a very good example of exactly that. It really is good to drive and pretty quick too.",2023,5,2
"Good stuff interbear. 
 
Dog mode... I had to google that. Clever idea, but possibly still not legal in the uk? 
 
I drag our labrador around in the boot of a e208 no problem, though in hot weather I put the back windows down a bit for air circulation. 
 
Two things I've learned that you might find useful: 
 
 live traffic is on a subscription that expires 3 years after registration (though I imagine Teslas are more subscriptiontastic so you're probably expecting this). 
 Peugeot will give you a paper log book if you ask, but your salesman (if like ours) might say ""oh all maintanence is logged electronically now so there's no paper log book"". The paper log book is better in my opinion as this frees particularly the post 3 year driver from using a Peugeot garage for servicing (as independent garages can't access Peugeot's electronic maintenance logs) 
",2023,5,2
"I asked Peugeot customer service about charging to 100% and got this reply 
 
""I would like to inform you that charging your vehicle up to 80% is recommended to preserve the battery life of your e 208 vehicle also a charge when the vehicle is above 10% is recommended rather than waiting for it to be under 5%. Of course, that doesn't mean the battery won't wear out over time but it will help towards the longevity of the battery life. "" 
 
They did also answer by phoning and I got the feeling that the person on the other end didn't really know much about EVs (ie understand that the e208 has quite a large buffer), so I wouldn't completely trust this advice.  
 
That said, charging to 80% ish works for me as I mostly do short journeys, so I do follow their advice, and just guesstimate the number of hours charge required on my Zappi (also using Octopus Go). If I'm going on a long journey I am not afraid to charge to 100% and take advantage of the cheap electrons. 
 
I'll post a dog guard picture a bit later.",2023,5,2
"We have an e-208 in the family (almong with a Tesla M3 RWD, a M3 LR and a Fiat 500e) and my understanding is that, like the Fiat, it is fine to charge to an indicated (but not actual) 100% because of the inaccessible buffer, presumably there to protect the battery. 
 
Surely Peugeot would give a straightforward way to charge to 80% (I'm unaware of one) if this was necessary/recommended best practice?",2023,5,2
"I put this Travall dog guard in as our dog would definitely have jumped over when he was younger. Even now as an adult dog he might try it if he thought he could steal some food, though he'd probably wedge himself stuck

"Hi All, 
 
I've been a member of this forum for around a year now alongside collecting my Golf GTE. I used this forum a lot whilst making the decision on whether to go electric or not, and I'm looking to find people in a similar situation - who haven't yet made their decision to purchase an EV/PHEV. If so, I'd be interested to know, are your reasons contextual, i.e lack of charging infrastructure near you, or psychological?",2019,3,27
"I'm not doing the questionnaire - but my reasons were to save money - I can go 200 miles on less than it takes an ICE to do 10miles or 1 litre. I live next to a petrol station and I haven't stepped onto it or into it for over a year and a half  
 
And I have the clunkyness of any ICE engine these days.",2019,3,27
Agreed a 10th of the price was my reckoning.,2019,3,27
"I haven't bought yet. There are three reasons why: 
 
 I have a car. It still works. It's got almost 80k on it and has never had any work done so it's perfectly fine. Getting something else now seems indulgent, even though its value is going down and it can only be a matter of time before it needs some kind of work. Probably. 
 The options at the moment are really limited. It's getting better all the time, but when a new model's announced there's a massive wait for delivery. It feels like we're definitely heading into an EV future, but we're some way away yet. 
 Cost. While running costs of EVs are a lot lower than petrol guzzlers, there's no getting around the fact that the upfront cost is higher. It feels like paying more for getting less. Properly test driving a Zoe was an eye opener - the experience of it was great, but inside it's as basic as can be.  
 There are ways around all these things. I hate the idea of PCP or similar because if I'm paying for something I'd like to own it, but that model would help.",2019,3,27
"My EV costs around 3p per mile for 'fuel' based on 4 miles per Kw and 12p per Kw on my home tariff. So that would be £6 for the 200 miles mentioned = 3p per mile. 
 
An ICE would use around 4.5 gallons @ £5.50 per gallon for 200 miles = around £24 - or 12p per mile. So that would be 4 times as expensive to fuel an ICE when home electricity is used in an EV instead.",2019,3,27

"I had my eye on an i3 for a year or two and the new battery with bigger range tipped the balance. I had a 3 litre diesel X5, 15 years old. It was too big for what we needed and getting towards end of life. 
 
I was never interested in a hybrid because it is really just a way of reducing running costs without the full benefit of electric. Ditto a range extender.  
 
Difficult to justify the initial cost of an i3 but once I had driven one it changed my mind completely. In fact, a decent EV makes you realise that an ICE is so clunky - noisy, smelly, environmentally unsound.  
 
Contributors to this forum don’t need telling but I have to explain to people that an EV has no oil because there is no engine, it has no water because there is no radiator. Servicing comprises a brake check and not much else. They are near silent at low speeds and will out accelerate all but the very fastest performance cars. But, that’s just my opinion!",2019,3,27
What I wonder is how much off this wear and tear is due to sitting for 100k miles on a rattling platform?,2019,3,27
"I've got a Kona on order, but I'm not yet fully committed, though I'm increasingly leaning that way. 
For me it's just a bucket list thing if I'm honest. There's no way it makes financial sense as I don't/won't do the miles. I'd like to claim green creds, but unless after me the car goes to someone who maxes the miles it'll probably have used more energy to build (compared to an equivalent ICE) than the fuel savings. 
But I've become increasingly fed up with ICE - the continuing addition of emission controls is making them complex and 'unreliable', in which I include things like hesitating when the throttle is pressed. It doesn't inspire confidence. (I'm not against such controls  per se , but they do make driving and ownership more difficult.) 
 
We looked seriously at the i3 a few years back, but there were too many gotchas - price, range (the REX looked good at first but as it couldn't maintain motorway speeds it seemed less shiny) and the final killer for us, a three adult family, was the rear door arrangement. 
I was also seriously considering a PHEV, but they just seem a kludge to me - they have most of the advantages of a BEV but also many of the disadvantages of an ICE with a load of extra complications on top. 
 
The arrival of an 'affordable' 250+ mile hatchback was the tipping point for me. The problem I now have is that SWMBO has just found out the price ... I have work to do there ",2019,3,27
"I'm much the same as chanticleer. I own a fully operational ICE that suits my needs and hasn't had any issues in the 85,000kms I've owned it. In NZ we have a very limited range of very expensive vehicles. Anything affordable would still cost a lot and give me very little range. I generally work from home, and any most of the commuting I do into town (7kms each way) I take a small motorcycle. Which leaves mostly countryside driving.  
 
From a purely financial sense, it would be silly to purchase anything now. From an environmental sense I'm just better off planting 15 trees a year on a bit of land I have.

"Wanted to wait until next year for a Zoe 2 with faster 100kWh CCS charging but my dirty diesel Fiesta Zetec Sport let go last month so had to get a replacement car quick and decided life was too short, there is always something better coming and hearing good things about my local Renault Zoe dealer, DSG Morecambe and actually talking to a Zoe owner here in Lancaster decided to take the plunge!  
 
Best car I've ever owned, much faster than the old Fiesta and surprisingly good around the corners despite lack of harder springs and being so high off the ground. More boot space and just better all around. Have managed with the slower charge rate of 22kWh which isn't really that bad, just means waiting 45 minutes instead of 20 mins and I only do long journeys once a month. Home charger ground earths has proved challenging but that's more Chargemasters fault than Renault. Luckily I've had free charging at the local Uni not very far from my house and now the home charger works its happy days! Have now done 2000 miles in first month of ownership ",2019,3,28
"I was aware that the i3 has both oil and water but the oil is like the oil in your ICE back axle - for the most part you wouldn’t know it was there. Ditto water cooling which many large electronic systems have anyway. Compared with oil changes, oil filter changes, oil leaks, radiator antifreeze requirements, water pumps and water leaking from hoses we are talking a different order of magnitude. Then there are exhaust pipes, manifold gaskets etc, etc. How about injector failures, carburettor needles sticking (going back a few years!). Agree there will no doubt be other problems but they are more likely to be electrical/electronic. With good design these failures can be minimised but you can’t easily design frictionless bearings, no-fail gaskets and so on.",2019,3,28

We used to get prospective customers in our showroom asking about the warranty duration difference between the 2 Korean sister brands. I could only reiterate that with shared bits underneath, they were as good as each other. 
Both brands were basic back then, but very reliable, with no common faults that needed fixing under warranty.",2019,3,28
"Gosh, you guys in the UK have so many EV options we don't have in the USA. The Zoe sounds like a no-brainer, especially if you buy used. Here the Fiat 500e can be quite cheap used, partly because the Fiat brand is new here. Used i3's and Mercedes B Class Electric all look good used. Leafs are cheap too, but battery degradation is an issue. 
But any EV is much easier as a 2nd car, which is pretty common here. Husbands and wives both work and there's no decent mass transport outside of the big cities. 
The one other factor that has caused many of us to spend way more then it makes sense to spend, is that we want to support Elon Musk and experience what it's like to own a Tesla NOW, not later. (I'm near retirement, so my view of the future is shorter than yours!) I'll be really excited when you guys can see the Model 3.

"for me it's pure economics. We recently went down to one car; a (so far) reliable 7-year-old diesel SUV. We do maybe 6-8k miles a year. The car has done depreciating, has no finance and the running costs are minimal. Our next car will be an EV but it makes no sense switching, no matter how much I want one, until the current car becomes unreliable. I looked into buying an older EV for local day-to-day travel and renting an ICE SUV for the 4-5 holiday weeks but the numbers still don't stack up. I might still do that when the time comes rather than buying new, depending on when that is, though I wonder how easy it is to rent an SUV that will take the same bike racks, etc...",2019,4,9

"Again I've split this off from the Clarkson thread as I feel it doesn't relate to that particular line of conversation, but I do think it's a valid point worth discussing. 
 
I was speaking to my wife about this on the way to town this morning (in the LEAF, it's nice and quiet so conversation is easy).   
 
I think it's pretty poor what the mainstream/old school car manufacturers are doing, they're still looking down on and generally abusing consumers and the governments from their loft position and dominant market positions. 
 
As said elsewhere in the VW e-Up! conversation, surely there's NO WAY that car is worth what, £9-£10k more than a regular e-Up! in terms of production cost, but even if it were, to expect a combination of consumer and government to foot the bill is just not right. 
 
Tesla, being what they are, have a plan that, to an outsider, seems to make sense. Start with premium models, a high-speed ""test"" at first to attract crazy pioneers, then the Model S, to attract a very keen and ""ready to go"" market, risk takers and high-earners who want something new, then the Model X, then go from there. It all makes perfect sense, they're almost being Apple-esque in their approach and I like it... but they're a rare example (and it doesn't all look rosy at all either). 
 
Now take the mainstream manufacturers. I drove a MINI E many years ago. BMW make good profits, record profits. They could make a MINI E tomorrow and I guarantee with the MINI PR machine behind it and a decent range (not even amazing range) it would sell by the bucketload. 
 
BMW/MINI are not alone in this, at least they're doing something, and they're putting their money behind it and it's already paying off. 
 
By why is the LEAF so costly, why does the i3 have such a high price? These companies could make very successful, low profit vehicles now, funded by their old-school vehicles, and they could, I'm sure, have the ability to transform the marketplace by increasing demand, lowering cost, and making EVs the mainstay. 
 
Apparently the Fiat 500e is about the best Fiat 500 money can buy. But it's a lot of money, and only available to one, small market. Crazy. 
 
If governments stopped the funding and legislation, it feels like the mainstream manufacturers would just pack up their EV toys and go back to their old ways, but they wont do it without government support and funding... it's a stupid, stupid situation. 
 
Buy buying, driving, and in our own way promoting EVs of all shapes and sizes we're doing our bit, I wish the manufacturers would reciprocate, I know it's not the PC or phone world, but I'm sure they could evolve this tech faster than they are, make it more affordable, and sell many, many more cars. 
 
Nissan have done it, but seem to be stalling for years, Tesla are doing it they're own way, and now BMW are going at it from a different angle... the landscape is changing and in five years I doubt we will recognise many of the debates and discussions going on in here, but I wish it could be sooner.",2014,2,3

"I'm reading here something completely implausible. BMW have established their niche as a premium brand with a sports connotation. There is no way that they will produce a non premium-priced product, its just against the company culture and what also not what their current customers expect. BMW wants you to see BMW ownership as elitist. BMW owners want to see their car as elitist. 
Nissan and Renault are simply not in that bracket and producing an EV is possibly a lifeline and the possibility an attempt to re-energise their failing brand(s).  
It would be suicidal for Tesla cars to debase their brand by producing a low cost EV - no matter what Elon says at this point. Brand is everything to a company - worth much more that its real estate, yet its intangible. A low cost long, range car is an oxymoron - but if it were to carry the same brand it would simply debase the core product and that vehicle could no longer achieve a premium price! 
The only way to get car prices down (and performance up) is, perversely not to buy them. Market forces are what manufactures respond to - not owner/buyer opinions?",2014,2,3
"Do we have room for a conspiracy theory here?Are the manufacturers and oil companies colluding to artificially restrict or suppress the development of EV technology? There is obvious profit in doing so for both parties - continued reliance on resource and replacement ICE engine parts for the lifetime of the car yield rolling  revenues.Then along come tesla with a completely clean slate and no edicts to adhere to, and voila: a normal looking car with 300 miles of range. They never needed to consider integrating the ICE into their platform, so they didn't need to compromise.Perhaps the major manufacturers are worried about a mass exodus from ICE vehicles?",2014,2,3

" 
 
1) 200 real world miles is probably several years away and that is even if Nissan decide to do a Leaf with that range. Much of the noises coming from Nissan suggest that they will not take the Leaf capacity much about the 30kWh as they have other plans for longer range cars... probably in the Infiniti brand.

"These days I drive almost no miles. I mean, I regard it as almost none. I have a 4 mile commute that I could walk in less than an hour if I really needed to, and if it wasn't for the 80 mile family-visit trip I do once a fortnight (or longer) I probably would do just that and walk it. 
 
Yet ... that still adds up to 6,000 miles. Plus the vey rare bits of shopping and an outing to a National Trust or such, I'm not particularly sociable so really next to no excess mileage above that, I can look to be doing about 7,000 a year at the moment. 
 
For basically 'no miles a year' from my POV. 
 
So my question of the hour .... why do people even bother to get a car if a 5,000 miles a year lease would cover their needs? 
 
It's always struck me, and I feel it is as true now as when I said it in the age of 22kWh cars, if you do too few miles an EV is likely too expensive and not worth it, and if you do too many then an EV won't suit. 
 
BEVs live in a range of 'golden miles', and as I have alluded to in other threads, not only on cost but also on CO2 grounds, right now this precise moment it makes more sense for me (personally) to stick with an efficient Euro 6 diesel. I'm not in that golden zone of miles that makes BEV a particularly sensible option. 
 
I'm not wanting to debate the relative calculations, and for someone looking for a new car and in different circumstances they will have different needs and outcomes. 
 
But the thrust of my thesis here is that anyone who only 'needs' 5k miles a year probably doesn't 'need' any miles at all. 
 
I'd have said, these days with batteries as they are, if you are doing 12k to 15k miles a year, you'd be pretty dumb not to go for a BEV. 15k to 30k a BEV will pay in spades if it covers your particular mileage, or you probably could do with a PHEV to eek out the dino juice, or above 30k really it is an ICE for you. At 5k to 12k it will depend very much on your circumstances if you already have a car whether it makes sense to swap it out (like mine, short trips with occasional long, or regular 50 mile round trip commute?, ICE or BEV is usually fairly clear). 
 
5k? Get a bike ....",2021,8,13
"Pretty much sums up my predicament Donald. 
I'm presently driving both a PHEV and a BEV, but having split with the OH during the final lockdown and returning to live in a city centre there really is no need to own either vehicle as I have access to a Co-Wheels club car when needed and like to travel by train to access other towns and cities where my business is based. Over the next 6 months both leases will be coming to an end and I won't be looking to replace either.

"£21667 for 214 mile MG5 52kWh, £22699k for 250 mile MG5 61kWh (inc metallic paint via the Affinity scheme).

"I don't use my 5k lease for commuting but still need a car for the household especially if you have kids. In fact I don't recall a year in the last 20 when I've ever done more than 5k. 
It would never be practical outside of a town/city to rent by the day/hour and all the associated aggro with availability etc. 
So it's part luxury, part necessity but at an average cost of around £240 pm(maintained), it isn't really expensive in the grand scheme of things. Many households spend similar amounts on phone contracts+TV subscriptions etc. 
Sure it's more expensive than running a 10 year old diesel but the difference isn't as huge as you might think once maintenance and fuel and VED are considered. And you get to drive a new, smooth ""clean"" vehicle. 
A 5k lease also encourages you not to make unnecessary trips etc, which is a good thing too.",2021,8,13
"Getting my Model 3 on a 5k lease simply because i want one.

The end game is to have just the M3 and a Leaf. 
 
I think if people want a car on 5k lease thats fine, whether its worth it is indeed open to debate, it is worth it for me personally and i cannot wait till delivery next month. 
I did the whole lease VS PCP thing to death in my head before hand.",2021,8,14
"It’s kids for us too.  
 
On our fourth lease car, just hopping from one good deal to another, initially I needed a car for work and it was a good way to get the car I liked. Then we had first child and still ran one car but it was good to have something modern and safe and reliable. Had second child and were doing nursery runs every day so went PHEV then BEV, mileage dropping each time as I moved to WFH (before covid!).  
 
Used to rent a car for the few times a year we needed a second but when the convenient depot closed we bought an older petrol MPV to cover that and when we’re carrying bikes and camping stuff, or when family visit from overseas.  
 
Kids are older and at school (which is closer) so walk/scoot/cycle unless it’s tipping down or we’re really late. Might lease again, but may just go down to the petrol MPV for a bit until I can afford a decent EV replacement.  
 
I wouldn’t discourage anyone leasing a BEV on low miles, will be more good used cars about in a few years time.",2021,8,14

We’ve got the Tesla for bigger journeys and our combined mileage is unlikely to exceed 15k per year.  
 
It really is a case of spend on a 15 year old ICE car we’re really fond of, or get a small, short range, low miles ev. Environmentally it’s probably even stevens, and I know my wife will be annoyed by all the binging and bonging that any new car brings, so we might just leave it another year and think again.",2021,8,14

My first Prius (2001) was incredibly tight at 9.4m. It seemed almost akin to a London cab!

"Hi all, 
 
Just got a new job which will involve 3 x 40 mile commutes per week so looking at an EV as I don't fancy putting the miles on (or spending that much time in) my Clio 200 track toy. 
 
Wife will also use the EV for her 10 mile commute on the 2 days I don't use it. 
 
So basically the car will just be used for lots of short journeys, so range isn't really a concern, however the more the merrier of course. About the furthest I could ever see me taking it would be to visit family 50 miles away. I have other cars I would use for longer journeys. 
 
Considerations: 
 
 I can charge for free at work (just off a 3 pin plug however, but I'm there 8 hours each day) 
 I will be charging off a 3 pin plug at home also (Have access to 2 other cars so not mega worried about getting into a situation where the car cant be used because it hasn't finished charging) 
 Rural commute, avg speed 50mph. 
 Budget 10-15k but am flexible. Want something that isn't going to kill me in depreciation. 
 Warranty would be nice, but surely these EV's are reliable? Wishful thinking probably. 
  
 
Things I would really like (although none are deal breakers): 
 
 Ability to pre-heat the car remotely. 
 Small footprint so I can park/charge it in a typical UK garage. 
 Folding mirrors to help with the above point. 
 I'm a bit of a geek so would like the ability to remotely connect to the car to check state of charge etc (not sure if this is even a thing). 
  
So far the main consideration was a BMW i3 or i3S... because I am at heart a petrol head, and would love something that has some fun factor... however from looking around today I see EV's do seem to be plunging in price. Some very low mileage/new Zoe's seem to be available for under £15k, as well as many other options I probably haven't looked into.

Maybe he'd weighed up the Bik & decided EV rather than diesel/petrol, who knows? 
 
Whatever, it meant one more EV on the market, and I bought it slightly cheaper than another (virtually identical) Ampera I'd seen on sale. So yes, the trickle down aspect works, and I believe I (& hopefully the planet) have benefitted from the extra EV-ness, it's been managing 90 mpg for it's second 3-year stint.

"Given that the limiting factor for EVs at the moment seems to be supply not demand, I'd rather see government mandate a certain percentage of EV sales, rising each year.  
 
Giving an incentive inflates demand which isn't lacking, but mandating a certain minimum number of EVs sold would directly force manufacturers to make more vehicles if they wanted to carry on selling. 
 
Alternatively mandate a certain minimum fleet emissions economy, rising each year. That would have the advantage of being fairly technology neutral at first. Manufacturers could meet it in the early stages through everything from just selling small, fuel efficient ICE vehicles to ballancing gas guzzlers with BEVs, or buying credits from manufacturers selling BEVs.

I put my card in and €49.99 was debited. For my €49.99, I got approx another 25% as it went up to 60% full. This seems like and awful lot of money and much more that the cost of petrol or diesel.

"Hi 
I have had my  Sync.24.7 charger installed on my driveway at home and am very happy with it. However, I have stumbled across a problem regardiing the charge cable. 
 
Once the cable is in place and charging has commenced the cable is locked into the car and the wall. Once the charge is complete and the led flashes Yellow to indicate so, the tether unlocks from the wall. if you remove the cable fromthe wall you can then remove ot from the car, without your keys and with the car locked. 
 
My charging is usaully complete at 2am therefore after 2am anyone can remove the cable and walk off with it without any problem. These cables cost around £100 to replace and I doubt it will take long before the light fingered members of our society will work out that if a yellow flashing light is clearly displayed then the cable is there for the taking. 
 
I have contacted Sync  EV.24.7 regarding this issue and to date have not received a responce. 
 
Please tell me there is a setting that I'm missing to secure the cable post charge that will ensure the cable can not be removed so I can turn off my alarm setting for 2am and sleep through the night.",2022,5,5

"Yeah - my iD3 won’t allow the cable to be removed until I unlock the car.

It's not just the cables being unplugged, I've heard occasions where tethered cables have been cut off a wall box, probably much more costly to replace. I suggest you get down screwfix and get a wall anchor point and chain the cable to the wall if you're worried about it being pinched.",2022,5,5

"I have a cash budget of between £28 and £36 max. No intention to buy with finance, this will be a cash purchase from my savings. I am an active retiree, just sold my Nissan Leaf 40kwh that I have enjoyed over the past two years. My driving is mainly local up to say 60 miles return, with longer journeys a few times a week of up to 160 miles or a tad further. So basically help me with my options. Your views and opinions will be valued. 
 
 
So, first option another Leaf. Possibly a secondhand 62kwh E Plus at 26k. But I have owned a Leaf for over two years now and really fancy a change. How about an ID3 ? Yes, but new they are £35k for the poverty spec Life model and £35k is close to a price of a secondhand high mileage Model 3. Maybe bust my budget and buy an early 2019 Model 3 then, but with all my funds spent to the max then I would be living off bread and water….. 
 
Then there is the new Cupra Born, priced from £34k new. Better spec than the ID3 at a cheaper price. How about a used early Model S, seen some of these on Autotrader priced at £32k. But that could be a risky purchase with no warranty. If anything went pop then with no cash funds left I would be up shit creek, in a leaking boat, with no paddle. Lastly, here is a wild card. The Peugeot e2008. Drove a 2020 GT line model a few days ago,priced at £29k. Absolutely loved it, lovely interior, good ride,loads of kit,in many ways I liked it better than the ID3.

It really is down to your use case depending on what will work for you, If you're happy to break your long journey with a charging stop then that opens up other models with less range and more choice. There will be lower cost cars from chinese vendors in the UK soon one of them may meet your needs at a lower price point. Will this be your last new car? that opens up another set of considerations. You need some better criteria must have, nice to have and don't care list out the key attributes from you're use case and go from there.",2022,4,7
"Thanks for the replies. I think with the id3 that buying new is not a good idea, especially as the Cupra Born is better specified and also a tad cheaper. I looked on Autotrader to see if there were any used id3 reasonably priced but prices start at a stiff £34 for an early 70 plate. I did briefly test drive a Kermit green launch edition Mokka E last summer and liked it. Loved the colour and the interior. Made in Germany by  Opel.That is a possible option secondhand at circa £28.

"Hey all, we're in the process of ordering a Level 3 Electric for delivery in the New Year.  
 
Like many, we absolutely love the car but are slightly concerned about range. As Londoners, 99% of the time it'll be absolutely outstanding, however, we are a tad concerned about what sort of range to expect when we're doing longer journeys.  
 
They seldom happen, (1-2 times a year), but when they do, they're typically long and we're not on a jolly, but instead aiming to get from A to B as fast as possible.  
 
We currently have a C350e PHEV and have made the 1000 mile trip from London to Bratislava numerous times before with an overnight in Frankfurt. During our last trip I made a concerted effort to plug the car in at every services we visited and I'm pleased to say that across Belgium, Germany and Austria we were able to activate AC chargers without issue. Adding CCS and bringing Ionity into the mix means I'm not concerned about finding chargers as they're plentiful along the E40 in Belgium, the A3 that takes us across Germany and the route across Austria.  
 
What does worry me slightly is how  often  we'll need to stop... My test drive gave me a chance to loosely measure consumption at about 220wh/km in mild, 14-degree conditions doing 70-75mph, but I'm not sure what range to expect of the car with the heat pump running with thicker air to power through in 0-3 degree temperatures... Would 100 miles of range be achievable ingreen mode and at a reduced speed of 120km/h/75mph?  
 
Obviously only time will tell, but I'd be interested to hear the winter motorway range experiences of owners on this forum to have a rough idea of how many stops the trip will truly require, otherwise it may just be all too hard and require the plane!",2021,10,26
"We've yet to use ours in winter yet, but you'd be better looking at reducing your speed to say 65mph to avoid heavy consumption. Then should be good for 100 miles according to most feedback on the ""Mini Electric UK"" FB group (which I recommend you join). 
 
Also, best is to precondition the car before you leave, whilst plugged in (and set to charge), for maximum range benefit.",2021,10,26
"I wouldn't fancy a ten charge trip - it sounds the wrong car for the job. Would it not be better to hire something? 
Also, on the tortoise and the hare principle, would you not get there faster door to door by dropping your speed to increase your range and cut out at least one charge per day? If a 10% to 90% charge takes an hour, would cutting your speed from 75MPH to 65MPH give you sufficient extra range to be able to ""only"" make 4 stops?",2021,10,26
"In theory, you might have ""100miles"". In practice you dont for a few reasons. 
 
Firstly, you generally dont rapid charge back to 100%. Charging slows significantly above 80% and its almost never worth taking it past 90. 
 
Secondly, you never run it down to 0%, because you always want to keep a bit of a buffer to get to an alternative charger etc. Depending on route that buffer might even be 10 or 15miles of range at the bottom end. 
 
Thus while the car might have ""100miles"" of range, you need to stop after 80miles the first time, and then because you've only charged to 80%, your subsequent stops are closer together still. 
 
Lastly, the chargers never quite line up where you need them, so you might find you have 80miles of range, but the chargers are either 70miles, or 90miles away. Clearly you end up having to stop at 70miles instead. 
 
 
I also suspect that 100miles in winter is not actually realistic for a car with <30kwh of energy, and certainly not if your trying to do 75mph. If your happy to take a leisurely jaunt across the country stopping every hour, then sure, its probably doable, but that doesnt seem to fit with your premise of ""aiming to get from A to B as fast as possible """,2021,10,26
"Thanks all - it's not a complete deal-breaker for us as we can and, 3-4 times throughout the year will, usually fly. It's more a case of guesstimating whether it'll take 10 stops or 12-14, I guess. Having a rough idea of what to expect on winter range wouldn't hurt, either, and I guess I'm going to have to learn that 65mph = faster than 75mph. Goodbye PHEV life! At the end of the day, given recent changes in our personal circumstances, there probably won't be instances where we couldn't turn it into a bit of a jolly if that was our only choice and we had a compelling reason to take the car.",2021,10,26
"It’s much the same (almost identical in fact) powertrain as the i3 and unless you stick to 65 mph maximum on motorways your range is going to be a bit less than 90 miles in winter, charging is not an issue as that powertrain will easily charge to 90% before slowing down. 
 
But basically….definitely the wrong car for your journey with your required “as fast as possible”.",2021,10,26
Here is the charge curve for the 94ah i3….so expect the Mini to be simila.,2021,10,26
"Yes, out the three options, I would always much rather drive. I find the whole experience of flying, airports, plane passengers, security, getting to the airport etc incredibly stressful, not to mention the environmental concerns. 
 
Train could be nice if the journey was broken up and it was more of a sight seeing trip rather than a A-B trip with the aim of spending most time at the end destination. 
 
Driving, even with traffic hold ups etc, is just by far the most civilised and convenient option IMO, and now with EVs it can be done with less guilt. Being able to pack a car with what you need on your door step, then get in it and go, can’t easily be matched.",2021,10,27
"Not trying to derail your thread, but unless you have your hearts and mind set on the Mini, have you looked at other cars with better range and similar size and money, such as the Fiat 500e or the Zoe?

Concerned about range since it would be our only car without a backup for longer trips. We have a driveway for installing a charging point, which would suffice most of the time.  
 
However, we often need to travel longer distances (150-200 miles, usually at night) to reach airports to visit family abroad with our young kids. This is as likely to be winter as any other time of year. 
 
Wife's colleague says she had issues finding working charging points coming back from airports with a Citroen EC4, but unsure if it's exaggerated.  
 
How is life with an EV in the UK, especially Northern England? Availability and reliability of charging points?",2023,6,21
"Welcome! 
 
I have an eNiro and in answer to your questions I would say don't be worried. There is rapid charging on all the motorway services areas and if you don't want to use those then you may have to drive a few miles extra but you will find somewhere sensible to charge. I have never not been able to charge on a long trip but occasionally it might be a little inconvenient.  
 
Availability... things are getting busier so yes, on occasions there might be a bit of a queue to charge and that could be a problem if you are in a bit of a hurry. I always try to have a backup plan if the charger I get to is occupied. At many service areas now there are many chargers installed so it is becoming less of an issue and overnight it is not likely to be a problem anyway. 
 
Reliability... it very much depends on the charging network. Some... like InstaVolt are almost all working... ones like GeniePoint are almost all NOT working! You will get to know the ones to avoid. If you arrive at a location to find the only chargepoint not working make sure you have a backup within range. I use Zap-Map for planning but there are others such as ABRP. 
 
I have not ever been worried that I wouldn't find anywhere to charge but it can be frustrating sometimes to have to even think about backup plans etc especially if you have kids/pets in tow that really don't want any delays and if that is the case then try to plan your route using main service areas, with multiple chargers from a reliable network... InstaVolt, Ionity, MFG, GridServe are my personal favs but there are others and I am sure other people will chip in. 
 
Always plan to arrive at your next charge location or destination with at least 60 miles still in the ""tank"". Over time you may become happy letting that get lower but I find that always planning 60 miles means that should I get to my next charge location and it is occupied or broken I will have enough to get me to an alternate. 
 
I would say go into it with a degree of flexibility. It won't be perfect and there is a learning curve during which you might make a mistake or two but don't let that put you off... push through that period and you will be rewarded.",2023,6,21
"First, longer journeys with a BEV are still not quite as simple as with a petrol or diesel car. 
 
With that out of the way, it's still generally fine. Work out roughly where you need to charge in advance, and have a few possible locations, ideally hubs with multiple chargers. Use Zap-Map (  EV charging stations & electric vehicles - Zapmap  ) or similar to locate rapid chargers. It soon becomes second nature. There are many other advantages to EV ownership that many of us find compensate for this slight inconvenience. 
 
On your particular car choices...the Niro 64 range is a step up from the Enyaq 60's. With the former you will normally only need to charge once, on your way back from a destination 200 miles from your house (or you could charge on the way there instead, but it's best not to leave the car sat near 100% charge whilst you go on holiday). With the latter, you will normally need to charge twice, once (briefly) on the way there, once (for longer) on the way back.

"I live in the North of England, County Durham to be precise, and have recently had to go back and forth between Stanstead and home a couple of times in my e-C4 (I am actually wondering if your wife knows my girlfriend!)  
 
It was absolutely no problem. There is a problem at Stanstead and a few other airports that there isn't any rapid chargers close by. However, there are loads on the motorways and A roads now. People really over egg this ""they're always busy"" and ""there aren't enough"" thing.  
 
But before you buy an EV, please download the Zap-map and WattsUp apps on your phone and get an idea of how many chargers there actually are.  
 
Just to give you an idea, here's a screenshot of all the rapid chargers I could have used.",2023,6,21
"is the enyaq 60 a smaller battery version? What WLTP do both have (eniro should be pretty high). Tim and Kat who I follow on youtube just did a 200+ trip in their fiat 500e. They didn’t buy it for long trips but they managed with a couple of stops. If its not often, you’ll be fine. You’ll probably be fine anyway.  
 
initial suggestion would be to use the google maps overlay from this forum that Snax produced -  Charging Hub Locations - Google My Maps   
 
I think it defaults to ‘tesla only’ being off but if not, make sure thats off. That’ll then show you all locations with 5+ chargers in a single place. More likely to have a free one available and not have all of them broken. Use that google map to trace out the routes you normally take to airports and have an idea how close you get to plenty of options to stop if needed.

As long as your 80% range will comfortably get you that then you are fine. Kia have the ability to pay £11.59 a month to get Ionity charging cheaper which if you are using it enough makes sense, not sure about Skoda if they do the same. 
 
As others have said, there are apps out there that manage the route to get to aa couple of options. When looking at the Skoda and Kia have a look at how battery preconditioning work as well - Kia use the in-built nav which is a bit pants IMO although you can have that running in the background.",2023,6,22
"My family are looking to go fully electric by replacing a Yaris with a small EV to complement our Tesla Model S. We've tried the Fiat 500 E and Mini Electric but the current favourite is a 2021 Zoe. 
 
We've been over to the local Renault dealer who have a few low mileage 2021's for sale. So far we've had a quick spin in one of them to check the driveablility, boot space, seating setup etc. but we're going back for another test drive with a reserved car this weekend. 
 
We've had the Tesla since new (6 years) so familiar with the EV experience & have home charging. Living north of the border we're also familiar with finding/using public rapids & have a ChargePlace Scotland card so that side of things should be covered. I'd be interested in any tips/things to look for on a nearly new car, e.g. checking software is up-to-date, battery health (unlikely to be an issue on a newish car?), included accessories (do Renault typically provide a granny charger or Type 2 cable?). 
 
We've had a look at a couple of YouTube reviews so are aware of the lack of side impact airbags but other than that the Zoe looks like an excellent value-for-money proposition. I've also seen this really helpful thread (apologies, there's probably a neater way to link to it!): 
 
",2022,5,12
"I've heard it's not good for the battery if the car has been left at very low state of charge for months, so I'd ask a question about that, I think half charged is ok, but not empty and not fully charged either. Probably not a biggy for such a new car, others on here might have experience of this. I bought a year old Leaf in 2013, and I think it had been left uncharged. Only 2000 miles on it. At 5 years old and having put 55k on it it had lost one fewer bars than required for a new battery and only had 55 miles useable range left.",2022,5,12
"My wife swapped her Yaris Hybrid for a new Zoe R135 GT Line just over a year ago. She's extremely happy with it, been faultless (so far) and is a much more refined car inside that the Yaris (lower road and wind noise, better seats, higher driving position). Only very slight niggle would be the rear door handles aren't as easy to use as they could be. Other than that it's a great little car, that seems to be remarkably efficient, too.",2022,5,12
"I test drove one of these last month. It's the perfect size for us and the extra range over things like the Corsa-e, Fiat 500e, etc. is very appealing. The only major obstacle is the fact that our local Renault dealer (where I test drove the car) is a complete arseclown. He made no bones about how much he dislikes EVs and how he thinks it's outrageous that we're all being forced into them. After the test drive, his monologue about how much better things used to be proved so tiresome that I got up and walked out after a few minutes of it. Unfortunately, it's a very small dealership so I'd end up having to deal with him whenever the car needed attention. 
 
Sorry, I digress. My advice would be to find out what the service manager/department's like. 😄",2022,5,12
"I guess it's worth checking that the supplied cable is genuine (or at least 3-phase like the genuine one). The car won't charge at 22kW on 22kW AC chargers if you use a single-phase cable. I don't know how you'd know though (and I'm not aware of anyone on here reporting being stitched up on the cable front, so it's probably unlikely).  
 
Also, CCS was optional on the GT Line, so if you want that, you need to ensure that the vehicle is an ""R135 GT Line Rapid Charge"" to give it its full title. 
 
Given that you're looking at such new cars, I can't really think of anything beyond what's in the thread that you linked to. As I said in the linked post, my 2016 Zoe has been a fantastic car, which is why I'm looking to ""stick with what I know"".",2022,5,12
"Easy to check if it has CCS, and so is really a rapid charge model. Open the charge port and there should be two dust covers underneath it. The upper one pulls away to uncover the Type 2 AC connector. If the lower one also pulls away to reveal two larger pins, then it has the CCS rapid charge capability. If the lower cover is fixed in place, and doesn't pull free, then it doesn't have the CCS capability and is not a rapid charge model.",2022,5,12

"Decision made today. We’ve agreed on a deal for a “Celadon Blue” GT Line with rapid charging. According to Johnny’s wife on the Late Brake Show this means my better half is a middle aged woman called “Hazel”  . We disagree though: really like the colour and more importantly the way it drives & high up seating position. 
 
Thanks for all the comments and advice above. We felt we made an informed decision including noting of the abysmal NCAP score. For our use case (almost all urban, 30 mph roads) we feel we can live with it. On the other hand we’re getting a car that could, on the odd occasion, comfortably do long distance trips and carry adult passengers, and we’re saving a few 1000 quid compared with current competition (Mini, Fiat, Honda - we didn’t test a VW E-up though). 
 
We have everything we wanted on the car we’ve picked with the possible exception of heated seats (we may look at getting an aftermarket retrofit but will see how we get on come the colder months first). 
 
We’ve also ordered a 3 pin charger having found one to be invaluable for trips away in our Tesla. I seem to recall that the Tesla mobile connector does bad things to the Zoe - not sure if this is still the case? but we think a separate charger for the Zoe will be a worthwhile investment.",2022,5,15

At that point I called the dealer and found out about the 8 month waiting list, so held off - now this...   
 
The government's logic here is flawed - with two kids, domestic holidays and loads of stuff to chuck around we need a large family car, but there is literally nothing on that list that will do the job for us. As a result we will probably have to go for a petrol hybrid instead which I'd rather not buy but makes far more economic sense given how our mileages have dropped. If they are serious about getting the mainstream to switch to pure EVs they should be basing discount on the car you are replacing or saying each family unit can have a PICG of X to put against any pure EV of their choice.

Also please don't pressume to go down the ""you don't own a Tesla so aren't best placed to say"" bollox. Pretty much every car in the past 10 years has had touch screen for a significant portion of the non essential controls. Radio, phone, satnav, media, settings etc. So the vast majority of drivers are well used to and experienced using touch screens. 
 
What studies have shown is that using physical buttons does reduce response times and increases accuracy by a measurable degree. But how much of an impact that has on the driver I would argue is negligible. It is also very true that a good clear graphical representation is better than a ""is that little black line mark on 2 or 3"".

For heater or fan ""set AC to 20"" or ""set fan to four"" etc are the simplest and least intrusive controls for anything I've driven  
 
(It was my wife who actually discovered & tried various the voice commands a few weeks after we got the car. When we are with each other or other people we never write things down... we speak & Tesla have designed their cars to react similarly). 
 
On the other hand we also have a Fiat 500e La Prima. We both love the Tesla but  adore  the Fiat even though on paper it is inferior (much better self driving, almost no SOC loss when parked compared the Tesla). Teslas are bland, the Fiat and many other cars have a personality and a soul.

"It always astounds me that people take umbrage to a dealership or car aales lot adding 15-20% to the price they gave you in p/x, they're businesses, not charities. Until you get under £10k, most people are more comfortable spending at a business than private sale, with finance options available. 
 
As always, it's the cost to change that really matters and selling via Motorway usually yields a bigger value for the outgoing car than the local dealership or WBAC coming in at a reasonable price and then chipping you down on everything that would be considered normal wear and tear by anyone's standards. 
 
I've had 16 new VAG cars and used to getting a 15% discount. In current climate, everyone's paying RRP,but the used prices are silly.

"Hello, 
 
New here. Have wanted to go EV for many years and thinking of taking the plunge around tax time, 2020. 
 
I've even thought about trying to find a working used Citi/Commuta car!! 
 
I'm thinking 2016 or 2017 (maybe 25) Leaf or Spark, with no more than 25k miles. 
 
My main concern is battery degradation. What should I expect around 70-100k miles. Will it just lose range and power, etc, or die all together. 
 
I know replacement batteries for the Leaf are around 5k for Leaf, maybe 10k (ouch!) for Spark. Are there signs that these might go down, because if the electric motor is still good, you should be able to keep it going. 
 
Can I get advice on this and opinions or used Leaf vs used Spark? 
Thanks!

But.... My understanding is that the shelf life of EV batteries is about 10 years/100,000 miles, and you will start to see degradation as they age. My big fear is buying a car and having to spend five thousand USD or more on new batteries. 
 
My daily commute is only about 22 miles both ways, so that's not a problem.",2019,10,12

"What strikes me in these sales figures, as I was explaining to my 12 year old, is that very few of the total BEVs, PHEVs, REXs will have ever come out of the pool of total vehicles. 
Due to their relatively young age, probably lower mileages, higher value. 
 
So even if sales are not increasing by much of a margin the cumulative effect is making more of an impact. 
Whereas used BEVs etc are probably taking an older petrol or diesel car out of the system. 
 
I.E, I am now on my 5th Leaf so each of my previous ones will have hopefully replaced an ICE.",2018,5,5

"The reason for my late figures is due to a holiday in California which really was an eye opener with regards to sales figures for EV's. If you look at the national EV sales they are not bad but lacking in overall percentage terms compared to the UK . However California really is holding up the states market. Hybrids are everywhere and models I am not familiar with after the Hollywood set snapped up the Prius in the early days. Plugin car's are almost as common as I would expect in Norway, I hadn't even left Los Angeles airport when I saw my first Model 3 and the list of models was almost endless both PHEV and BEV. Also several self driving Bolts in San Francisco.  
It was great to see such rarities as the FIT and Fiat 500 EV along with Toyota's RAV 4 EV. Also several Toyota hydrogen car's but those were mainly sat on dealership forecourts.",2018,6,16
"I think that the projections assume PHEVs will dominate in the early days until the BEV range is seen as adequate (whatever adequate might be) and the battery costs fall enough, and then the sales will swing over to BEVs. 
 
We need to sustain an overall growth (BEV and PHEV combined) of 40% p.a. to achieve 10% of sales in 7 years, and then 100% over the next 7 years (although common sense would indicate growth on the standard 'S' curve shape, slowing towards the end).",2018,6,17

Considering that UK government pay ~4k per car for promote this segment ... it is almost 200m pounds a year for support a market that is not really moving up. 
 
Maybe they should shift the incentive only for pure BEV and drop the support for PHEV",2018,7,6

Tesla's model 3 accounted for more than half of the sales with an estimated 14,250. Insideevs doesn't break the figures down for BEV v PHEV but it's obvious that BEV sales are pulling away from PHEV. There is a big gap between the top 8 selling models and the rest: no. 8 was the Nissan leaf at 1149, followed by the BMW 530e at 536. Of the top 8, only three are PHEV (Toyota Prius Prime, Chevrolet Volt and Honda Clarity PHEV). Then of course the most dramatic gap is between no. 1 Model 3 at 14,250 and no. 2 Prius Prime at 1984 (less than a seventh of the Tesla!).

When I owned one I always said it ""made every car park into a parent and child space"", and it really did. 
 
Here is my one (now two years sold) next to a Hyundai Tucson, which is probably about the same width as a Leaf:",2023,1,9
"Bring on the id1/panda/108 electric. 
Can't come soon enough.",2023,1,9
"The Leaf is actually quite narrow as current cars go. 
 
MG4 is wider. 
 
There's only the Zoe, stellantis Corsa/e208s/fiat 500 etc. Plus Honda E. Stellantis don't do one pedal. Range is better than the Leaf. Build quality is far worse. 
 
Honda E has one pedal and the 360 cameras. Build quality is nice. 
 
There isn't much choice. 
 
Probably easier to demolish the garage and make a slightly bigger car port!",2023,1,9
"I think the MG4 width is from it's wide backend looking at mine, otherwise lovely car and enjoy driving it but using carparks is getting to be a pain, I do wish they'd keep cars under 1800mm wide. 
 
MG4 4,287 mm L x 1,836 mm W x 1,504 mm H 
ZS EV 4,323 mm L x 1,809 mm W x 1,649 mm H 
Zoe 4,087 mm L x 1,787 mm W x 1,562 mm H 
Leaf 4,490 mm L x 1,788 mm W x 1,530-1,545 mm H 
 
Cripes the new Megane 1860mm wide! (and has a silly charge port location)",2023,1,9
"Hmm. A ""Small Family Car"" is what the industry calls ""C segment"" 
 
In familiar ICE terms, that means VW Golf, Vauxhall Astra, Ford Focus. 
 
LEAF, ID3, MG4 are all C Segment vehicles. 
 
If you want something smaller, you should be looking at B-Segment. which in ICE terms would be the Fiesta, Polo, Corsa type cars. MG3 is B segment. As is the Zoe, and ofcourse the Stellantis models such as the e208 and corsa-e etc.  
 
 
All cars are getting larger, i'm not sure why its a particular surprise, given its been happening for 30+ years? 
 
I drive an Audi A4 from 2000 as well as the EV. Its a D segment car, and yet its smaller than a MK8 Golf in every single dimension. Infact even a MK6 Polo is wider and taller!",2023,1,9

"Thanks everyone . We have a new automatic door on the and it's not too bad once we've got in (though we have bumpers on the walls just in case. There's probably about a couple of cm either side when driving in. As most garages on standard housing estates it's not a bad size. 
Good points about how accurate the advertised widths are but at least with some of them we know it's a definite no. It's not so much we want a super narrow but why are some of them so wide! 
At the moment It looks like a case of losing the one pedal function and going for the e208",2023,1,9
"My friend has a similar problem - his father built a garage in the early 1970's, without planning permission, basically by using corrugated iron panels around a Mk3 Ford Escort. When my friend buys a new car, he is restricted to a car that is the same dimensions as the old Ford escort, which is not easy as all cars seem to have ballooned in the last decade. 
 
He is currently driving a KIA Stonic, which is 1760mm wide 4140 length. 
 
The Stonic is basically sister car to the Hyundai Kona. 
 
The Kona dimensions are 1800mm wide (not including Mirrors) and 4205 length. 
 
So a tad wider that the LEAF - The Kona Offers one pedal driving as well - can't help you with the price though ",2023,1,9
"A couple more relatively narrow EVs to add to the list:

 BMW i3 (sadly discontinued but only last year)

We were coming off a smart forfour lease so went looking for same - ours is the second car though so could deal with being less practical. 
 
New pretty limited to Honda e (up is still on and off as VW can't make their mind up if they want to keep making it or not) the other two are fiat 500e and Mini but they only have 2 doors

"I agree with others that it really isn't a great idea. I can see why my neighbour bought a Corvette in Flordia and shipped it over here as a rare (in UK) and expensive car, but I wouldn't suggest doing it for something (if you excuse me) a bit mundane. Servicing and repairs would be a nightmare as not only the EV side but other parts are totally different - brake system, hvac, etc.  
 
If you aren't currently UK resident and have owned 6 months then you probably wouldn't have much to pay other than transport, but there is cost of IVA process with any required changes. And no, a USA Fiat 500e definitely can't use type approval of a EU petrol one!",2020,11,19
"I imported a Fiat from Jersey(!) in 1984. Apart from car tax & vat which I had to pay to the customs, the DVLC required a 'type approval certificate' from Fiat. This was pricey IIRC, and did not require any modifications at all. I certainly would not want to try the above with an American car.",2020,11,19
"I am not sure about cars but when I imported second hand american motor homes I just had to get a mot test. I had to convert the brake flashers to indicators and got Amber lenses. Then two circuit to the rear one for the new brake lights and one for the fog light with an illuminated switch.  
The light conversion sounds complicated but actually you just cut the brake feed to the stalk and divert to the rear.  
Oh I almost forgot white indicators at the front need changing to Amber.",2020,11,19
Looks like you'll need a basic IVA:,2020,11,19
"Parts vary more than you expect - I used to own a UK Citroen, whilst on holiday in France the rear light cluster was damaged. The French dealer did not have the UK part in stock so we fitted a French one and had to adjust the wiring loom in the car to get the sidelights to work. So someone now has a car which is half UK and half French wiring!",2020,11,19

The gentlemen and lady in the car were in their late 50s/early 60s which further reinforced our conceit, born out of the low insurance costs, that Rex is the car du jour of the retired/about to retire.

Had a busy EV spotting day yesterday too. One Tesla Model S, 3 LEAF, 2 Zoe's and several Outlanders. Most annoyingly there was a LEAF ""parked"" in a charging bay at Hamilton yesterday morning. Just parked, not charging. Thankfully there were 4 bays, 2 had Zoe's in them (both charging, or at least connected). I squeezed in to the 4th one.

"Hi everyone, 
 
I am new to EV and I hope to gain some knowledge over here. Please guide me if possible. 
 
Does a 41.8kWh battery that has a range up to 280km also means that 28km will consume 4.18kWh? Does this formula apply to EV to calculate the range per kWh or is there any method to do so?",2021,10,4
"That would be a reference consumption that they achieved for the emissions testing. Real world use is likely to be worse. 
 
If you tell us what car it is we can give you an idea of what you’re likely to achieve.",2021,10,4
"Additionally, consumption varies a lot depending on driving style, ambient temperature, wind, rain… all in all, the manufacturer’s quoted range should be regarded as somewhere near the best you will ever achieve, but not necessarily typical.",2021,10,4
"To answer the actual question, though: yes, you can get a rough idea of miles/kWh by dividing range by battery capacity. All the caveats mentioned above apply, though. And not only does actual range vary with various conditions, but the published battery capacity may not be the usable capacity, because makers create false 0% and 100% points to protect the battery from reaching its real limits, which would be dangerous with Lithium ion batteries. Some publish actual capacity, others usable capacity.",2021,10,4
"Another suggestion is to download a free copy of A Better Route Planner. You can change vehicle types and battery sizes and state of charge and get a real feel for how far you will travel over your typical journeys and where you might charge. The subscription version also compensates for weather and traffic and has a few other bells and whistles. Good tool for ""trying on"" different EVs before you buy!",2021,10,4
"EV Database  gives their estimates of 'real range' for a number of situations (as well as the manufacturer figure). These probably give a better feel of what you can achieve. 
 
The estimates for our Model 3 and Zoe are reasonable.",2021,10,4
"Thank you everyone for the response. 
 
I understand that the range given by the manufacturer won't be the same as compared to realistic driving and climate factors. The EV that I am looking at doesn't have any detailed specifications, thus I got to make some estimatation on the range itself. 
 
Cheers!",2021,10,4
"Hmm, 41.8 kWh & 174 miles. Just did a search at  ev-database.uk, range 170-180, and gort these suggestions, none an obvious bulls-eye! 
""Peugeot e-208"", ""Vauxhall Corsa-e"" 45 kWh 160m 
""MG MG5"" 48.8 kWh 139m 
""VW ID.3 Pure Performance"" 45 kWh 160m 
""Cupra Born"" 45 kWh 168m

""Fia 500e Cabrio 37.3"" kWh 178m BINGO? IS THIS IT??? Looks a really close fit! 
 
Have to say, I don't believe the Megane with 40 kWh will do 217 miles, looks like yet-another smoothed-off brick to me, but that's another thread!",2021,10,4
If the range given is upto 280km with a Chinese brand the numbers will be NEDC which is a very poor estimate. Think 150 km to 200 real km possibly less if loaded. Van's usually have the aerodynamics of a brick so keep the speed low to get any range.,2021,10,5
"Chances are you're not going to do quite as well as a Leaf 40, they're a thirsty beast but better aerodynamics than a van I'd guess. So as Spiny says, usable actual range likely to be 100 miles-ish before you want a topup.",2021,10,5
"Love it or hate it, Tesla's (or more likely Elon's) decision to call its level 2 autonomy Full Self Driving generates a lot of conversations on the topic. But Tesla is not the only name in town. Since most EVs have Level 1 (adaptive cruise control), I will just attempt to list the ones that have Level 2. No one in Europe (or the world for that matter,  sans Japan ) sells a Level 3 and above cars. 
 
Level 2 (Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Centering), incomplete list: 
 
 Audi E-tron 
 Ford Mustang Mach-e  (hands free) 
 Fiat 500e La Prima 
 Honda E 
 Hyundai Ioniq 
 Hyundai Ioniq 5 (hands free, lane change assist) 
 Hyundai Kona 
 Jaguar I-Pace  
 Kia Niro EV  (higher trims have even more autonomous features) 
 Mazda CX-30 
 MG MG5 LR 
 Nissan Leaf  (called ProPilot) 
 Porsche Taycan 
 Tesla: all Tesla models are legally Level 2 
 VW Id3, Id4 
 How well these autonomous features work in practice varies a lot. Jerkiness in steering and braking under ACC are very common problems. Also L2 in heavy rain/snow are pretty much unsolved. 
 
Now for pure speculation on the current major players, 100% my opinion: 
 
 Argo AI : This company has backing from both VW and Ford (each has 40% share) and it is already running a level 4 Fleet, and will soon be charging money for their Robo taxi service. VW also wants to sell this  self driving as a service . 
 Aptiv aka Hyundai aka Motional : They're still betting on Robo taxi but undoubtedly the tech will drip down to your Ioniq/EV6 eventually. 
 Toyota: I'm still disappointed about  Toyota's bet on Hydrogen , which could turn out to be another environmental disaster. But they've been investing heavily in self driving tech, and have announce significant spending in EVs. They recently bought out  Level 5  (used to belong to Lyft and have a very significant UK presence) 
 Tesla: The elephant in the room, with the most publicity. They also have the most number of high profile crashes. But thousands of drivers swear by it. 
 There are of course many other ventures not listed here (Waymo for example but they don't sell cars, they sell a service). If want a car with good autonomous assist in the near future that's not a Tesla, my bet will be on ArgoAI's ventures aka Ford/VW. The technology seems most matured and both companies are committed to EV (for the VW case it's a matter of survival).",2021,9,16
"BMW have level 2 on the iX3, does lane change etc as long as the navigation is enabled. 
 
Technically hands free works, just warns you to put hands back on, and the lane stuff works without navigation, but it won't take off roads etc without nav (as doesn't know where its going obv)",2021,9,16
"The Automatic Cruise control works pretty well in the E-Niro, certainly on Motorways, also useful in town with slow moving traffic, but there you need to be more alert",2021,9,16
Adaptive cruise works exceptionally well in the Nissan Leaf. Lane assist seems pretty pointless. Anti collision systems are ery difficult to evaluate.,2021,9,17
"However in Europe at least, this level 2 autonomy is a bit cut off at the knees, as can't stear over a certain percentage anyhow, so even the tesla system is half featured compared to usa.",2021,9,17
Would need a major improvement in the painting and maintaining of road markings etc before autonomous driving has any chance.,2021,9,17
"I went and test drove an S before ordering the bmw, and when I said I was testing a BMW to the guy at tesla he seated saying they don't understand electric cars in a snotty kinda way.  
 
To be fair, the S was nice enough to drive, fast but feels very 'soulless' like a lot of American cars, rapid in a straight line, boring any other time. 
 
And the fit and finish in a 70+k car was shocking, even on the demo car. 
 
Maybe when they get the 'car' part of the electric car I may be back, but for now I'll stick with a car maker, making cars. Yes the 'toys' might kot be as silicon Valley, but at least they all work as they are meant too.",2021,9,17

"Hello all, I am new to the EV world just recently stumbled upon the concept as I was browsing for my next potential vehicle purchase. So as I'm new to the EV scene, I've been doing my research and watching a lot of youtube videos and I've come to settle on a potential buy. The Nissan leaf caught my attention when I was comparing it to a 2017 fiat 500e and a 2016 Volkswagen e-golf. A local dealer has a used 2017 nissan leaf s with around 6,000 miles for around $13,000. Now the whole reason for this post, is this a good price for a first used EV? What was the price of your first EV (including year and make)?",2020,7,7
"Hi 
I'm afraid that this site has mostly UK based contributors, so our prices etc are not going to be relevant for you. Also, we never got the 500e over here. 
To answer your question, my first EV was a battery owned Renault Zoe ZE40 in 2017, and it cost just over £17,000 (brand new). I don't think the US got the Zoe, which is a shame, because it's a good small EV.",2020,7,7

"Hi  
First post. While I have no problem with range on trips, I left car at airport in November- December for 3 weeks. After buying 75d a few weeks before I estimated range loss of 5 miles per day, on returning loss was 70 miles which was  great.Left car with 181 miles as this was best I could do regarding the location of nearest Superchargers.I am going away for 3 weeks in February same airport .last couple of weeks I have noticed overnight loss of 6 miles and of course a few more during the day temperatures have dropped since November. Does range loss decrease when car is left alone no preconditioning on no app connection?",2019,1,29
"Have you turned on 'Energy Saving' and de-selected 'always connected' in the settings?  
 
This should limit the vampire drain to a couple of miles per day I believe. Should be good for three weeks.",2019,1,29

Spoke to B’ham SC they tell me that this is not featured on my September 2018 model .I had searched for this  before.Do you know if loss decreases over time when car is left alone. I will be returning in the early hours of the morning,and the airport has no facility for charging should I need to .Surrounding area is very very limited as well thanks",2019,1,29
"also plan where you might charge when you collect the car as if its been bad and you are very low you might not have enough range to get to a supercharger and need to be a member of one of the other charging networks might be needed - or lookup ones (before your trip) which will let you charge ad-hoc using a contact-less card. 
 
I noticed the other day when Bjorn Nyland came back from his 10 days in California he collected his loan fiat 500e and he had left it plugged in at the airport - there were dozens of cars all plugged in and covered in 5-6"" of snow - could well be into the hundreds and when you book you book a charging slot.

If you use a park and ride service or valet service or any other service where they require you to hand over your key then be extremely careful.

But it puts you in a very very grey area with your insurance company.

Furthermore, this week all new Megane E-Tech 100% electric was named Parkers Best Medium Electric Car in the 2023 New Car Awards: 
 
 Offering an eye-catching interior and exterior as well as a dash of very un-EV like agility…. The quality really measures up… The driver’s digital display and screen are glossy and easy to use, while the infotainment system is a Google-powered object lesson in brilliance, which should finally convince rival carmakers to leave what’s shown on the screen to the experts.  
 
We understand how excited you are to get behind the wheel and we’re working hard to ensure you receive your all new Megane E-Tech 100% electric as soon as possible. 
 
Your Megane is one of the first UK cars being built with care at our ElectriCity production plant in Douai, France, and will be subject to rigorous quality checks before being transported to your dealer. Your chosen dealer partner will be able to track your vehicle’s scheduled arrival date within the next two weeks. This means, in most cases, you should expect a delivery before the end of this year. Your dealer will contact you in the coming weeks with more information.""

But it's interesting comparing with his ID3 result in the table at the end, the main difference was not charging speed, it was efficiency. He must have had a very good run in the ID3. The Mégane charging speed is only slightly behind the ID3 (see Bjorn's other vid) but moreover I saw a Battery Life twin test a while ago in which he showed that if you plug in at high SoC (I think it might have been over 40%), whereas the ID3 does not hit the proper charge curve (which I can confirm myself), the Mégane did. So, it might not be a perfect 1000km challenge car but I suspect the Mégane charging will be pretty good for most UK use, because it won't be quite as critical to plug in at low SoC as it is in an ID3 (and personally I find an ID3 more than adequate for one/two stop UK trips)..",2022,11,19
"Well my worst case use is driving to Telford and back in a day over winter for the MiCC Radio Control Touring Car series. Total journey time in Zoe is 2.5h plus 45 min charging x 2 = 6h 30min. 
 
According to ABRP in the Megane I can drive straight there without charging and only need to charge for 15min on way back so 5h 15min total. Not a bad improvement of 1h 15min saved 🙂",2022,11,20

"If you don't want to pay for orange data plan here's how to use your iPhone (iOS 16 capable phone required) as a hotspot automatically each time you enter the car: 
 
If you want to use CarPlay for calls and media playback: 
 
Set in shortcuts app - automation - carplay connected : set hotspot enabled : turn off ask before running 
 
If you want to use Android automotive interface via bluetooth for calls and media playback: 
 
First configure driving focus mode in phone focus settings and set activate when connected to car bluetooth 
 
Then you can create similar shortcut action for driving mode as described for carplay above. 
 
Note: you have to create the shortcut through driving focus since bluetooth alone is not allowed to be used as a trigger in shortcuts without asking. 
 
You can also create a separate automation to turn hotspot off when carplay or driving mode (bluetooth) is disconnected.",2022,11,27

I can fully see this becoming a mass rejection or claims case moving forward, if you want to be covered, you should raise the complaint with renault uk within the first month of picking up the car.

In battery life test the ID3 wouldn't charge that quickly even in summer if you start the charge mid SoC. Would be interesting to know if this is fixed by now and whether Cupra has the same limitation. EV6 users waited for navigate to charger precondition for ages (hopefully they at least have it by now?). XC40 and Polestar forums are full of issues, some cars even mechanical breakdowns like engine / battery swaps, probable drive shaft / engine related vibration issues not even fixed with new tyres, LTE comm module requires periodic resets to function and you can imagine the car loses most of its functionality when it goes.

As far as the app is concerned, we also have a Fiat 500e for which the app refuses to activate climate remotely, the car reset the units to km from miles 3 times in a four day round trip this last weekend, the app fails to refresh so doesn't know charge level, and has its share of other glitches, but we live with them and watch the updates.

"I agree with those recommending a proper charger - especially in a rented house if I didn't know much about how well the electrics have been maintained. Maybe a deal can be done with the landlord - rent the charger for £250 a year or something? Fast charging is handy too for those days with extra trips. Maybe you'd be able to use Octopus Go etc as well? 
 
Corsa-E and E208 have similar 0-60 times to the i3. E208 has folding mirrors - not sure about the Corsa, but the e208 is wider than the petrol 208, could you get it in a garage and open the doors? 
 
Sounds like the Fiat 500e might suit better as it must be smaller, and you might get one for 15K with a bit of haggling. 
 
Reliability - errr in theory there is less to go wrong than an ICE car, but if stuff does go wrong then the battle might be finding a suitable mechanic as it's new technology, and sourcing parts. Can't complain about my e208 though, no problems apart from 'Collision System' warnings that come on when the car needs a wash (dirt on the bumper sensors   ).",2023,6,1
"Some good responses here. I would avoid the i3, as you won't have any/much warrantee and any faults will cost you a fortune at BMW. 
 
If you are buying outright and want to play it safe, then Hyundai or Kia are the way to go or a 2020 Zoe may have a 5 year warrantee as well (forgive me if I am wrong). 
 
Ioniq 38 is brilliant, but a tad conventional, which I am not sure is 'you' based on this thread. So how about a 30kWh Kia Soul? Came with 7 year warrantee.

"I actually own and run an i3 as my own car so this might carry a little more weight that the views of those who have not. 
 
You want an EV that puts a smile on your face. No contest IMHO BMW i3. No earlier than mid 2016 for reliability (the early ones 2014-2016 were bad and the mud stuck) and you want at least a 94Ah and that will give you 120 mile range in winter. For max range 94Ah plus REx. However for what you want to do a basic 94Ah (still comes with folding mirrors, passanger side auto dips in reverse really useful, with heated seats - key for winter commuting) will be sufficient, cheaper, handle better and have less to go wrong. The 2016 onward cars are very reliable and if it does need parts replaced due to wear then since they are mainly non-electrical items any good garage can do it at about a third to half of the price of taking it to a BMW dealer. Remember BMW dealer supplied complimentary coffee will really cost you about the same as tea at the Ritz. 
 
The i3 can be a very relaxed commuting car with lots of room in the front or if you start to exercise the right foot then it goes like a 70's hot hatch pocket rocket. Excellent efficiency, very else little comes close, avoid the urge (difficult) to make it sprint and you will easily get 5 miles per kWh in summer and personally after 5 years of owning a 2016 i3 my year round average is 4.5 miles per kWh. Preheat in winter is great and the free app works well for remote control of features. 
 
Downsides about which you may not care, small meaning really small boot (rear seats do fold ) and those marmite rear doors and four seater not five and BMW main stealers sorry I mean dealers. Even then a service is once every two years which works out cheaper than having an annual service with say a Nissan LEAF but any major electrical repair then BMW = Break my Wallet. Looks well a thing of beauty to some as ugly as sin to others. Much nicer inside than outside. 
 
Check width if you want to pop it into a garage, because of its height it is actually wider than it looks, length should be a non-issue. Easy to park, excellent turning circle. Cheapest BMW to insure (less than a Series 1) and it is able to outrun a Series 5 up to about 40 mph. Go and test drive one and see what you think.",2023,6,2

"ev database  has the 2020 e208 range as 120 - 255 miles. From my experience that is about right (never got to 255 miles, but that is city driving, presumably means driving below 40 all day long...). For a long drive with mostly motorway at ca 65 mph and leaving at least 15% charge / 1 bar out of 8, 160 miles in summer. In winter 120 if it's not too cold/dark/wet. Not tried a long drive in truely terrible weather, might need to make that 110 or less in such weather. 
 
That's probably more than the other 4 cars on the shortlist. 
 
The e208 is very good for motorways and fast roads - I imagine much better than the other cars on the list. I've test driven an ICE citigo and thought it was too bouncy and tinny for faster roads, though of course the clue is in the name and the EV version might be more solid.

"This thread is quite good fun, but reveals one of the things that annoy me about EVs and modern cars in particular - they cost too much to insure. This seems mainly because manufacturers design them for the wealthy, usually older, demographic who can afford all the gadgets, can afford the insurance and aren't affected by the higher insurance as much in any case. Small family hatchback EVs like the 208 don't need sub 8 second 0-60 times. To hit the net zero targets, at some point in the future everyone will need to give up their ICE habit and drive EVs, and there is more chance of a backlash if the swap involves an extra £1,000 on the insurance for a significant chunk of the population just to buy a basic EV like an e208. Similar problem to people who don't have driveways or are relying on a landlord for an EV charger, again disproportionatly affecting younger people. 
 
Err, slight rant, realise I am part of the wealthy older demographic offered cheap insurance.   
 
But the insurance problem might be mitigated with some EU regulation forcing manufacturers to provide low power/cheaper to buy/ cheaper to insure models as the price of doing business in their area (of course the UK is too small to do this on its own). 
 
Failing that if there is any enterprising person who can invent a 'Sport Mode Disabler' for cars like the e208 that might help.",2023,3,27
"I am 19 and have had my Renault Zoe 22kwh since I was 18. Used temporary insurance while I was learning which was incredibly cheap and managed to get insurance when I passed for only £1,800 without a black box (What's the point of having an EV if I get punished for using its instant torque). After over a year of ownership, the only downside for me has been range. I manage to survive with its lets be real 60 mile motorway range in Scotland as the charging network is decent, there is only the need for one app and pretty much anywhere I need to be isn't far away. The main reason I purchased a Zoe is because they were really cheap and I could charge for free in Glasgow and still can. I paid around 6k in great condition, 96% battery health, 50,000 miles. I would highly recommend a Renault Zoe Q90 which is the same as my car but with double the range. It may not have 50kw dc charging but it has 40kwh AC charging which no other car has and because of this all the 43kwh ac chargers are always free and you can take advantage of the many 22kwh ac chargers which most cars can't take advantage of so when ur in a pinch even though its not as fast as DC charging its 3 times faster than most dc charging cars. I'd look again into insurance and try changing small amounts of details, i.e. how many miles per year and named drivers etc. We have 5 EV's in our family so lemme know if you have any questions cos we have a bunch of experience.",2023,3,27

"Someone mentioned why don’t they sell slow evs, I think the problem is torque is one of the main differentiator for ev right now. In another thread someone commented a Niro ev is around £6k more than an equivalent spec Niro (not checked this myself). Until price parity is met, something needs to differentiate and the biggest win for evs is the effortless wafting around. Why would you pay £6k more for an eniro if it wasn’t better? I doubt a more powerful motor is making up much of the price difference.",2023,3,27
"That sums up the manufacturers dilemma. They are selling to the wealthy where these things are important. In 8 years time the EV might be only £1,000 more to buy than the ICE Niro, but cost £1000 more plus per year to insure for a new driver. The wealthy new buyer gets to decide what this new form of transport looks like. 
 
Maybe this is how it always has been and over time the market will mature hopefully. 
 
If you could turn down the torque for those that can't afford or who don't need it and prefer not to pay as much insurance? Monitored by an app of course!

"OP, A few thoughts on Ioniq 38. Range in winter in bad weather can be as much as 200 miles. My 1st ever trip in mine was the day after I'd bought it, 10C temps, at night + heating on, 2up, we did a 160 mile non-stop trip almost all duals/motorways. As I had no idea of the range, I sheltered behind HGVs for 80% of the trip. Did the 160 miles & still had 40 left in the GOM. GOM on these is v accurate, unlike some! These days I do the same winter trip at lorry + 3 mph sort of speeds, and arrive with 20 miles left in the GOM. In summer I'll travel at more like genuine 65 & arrive with 20 in hand. 
Drive super slowly, <45 mph, and I can get 7 miles/kWh from it = 265 mile range, but that's too slow for normal travel, though perhaps acceptable on the Isle of Wight for eg! 
 
Speed & acceleration? 0-60 is 9.7 secs, power 134 hp acc to  Hyundai IONIQ Electric  
so it's no road-rocket, which is probably a good thing for a newbie! That said, it can travel v nippily if needed, as can most EVs, simply because the acceleration's there instantly. Whether it looks like a taxi or not should be irrelevant at this stage of driving. Mine looks good in Fiery Red, but the front grille in silver just looks tacky, so I'm tempted to get that sprayed to match the rest of the car, would improve the looks 500%. 
 
Dunno if the Ioniq 28's cheaper on insurance, but that has a summer range around 160 miles, winter 120 acc to most reports. But if I drove it the way I did my 1st trip I'm sure I could get 160 miles in winter at 10C wet road, though it would be a rather slow journey! The 28's cheaper to service, as the battery is air-cooled while 38 is liquid, so needs expensive coolant swap every 4 years - perhaps £250 extra? Something like that. 
 
Battery in 28/38 is reckoned pretty bulletproof with v low degradation, so I wouldn't worry about one >30k miles on it. 
Some of the 2019 & 2020 built 38s (including mine!) have had a battery swap, so I now have a brand new battery at 27k miles! So some of the 38s on sale will be in the same position! Could be a v crafty buy! 
 
There's been a coolant problem in a lot of Niros & Ioniqs ecently, H have apparently sorted this, so assuming they  have , these are looking to be pretty good value cars. Far better range than any other ""cheapo"" 45 kWh EV around, their efficiency means they're the cheapest to topup per mile, with possible exception of tiny e-UP!

"Ok, so this is aimed at potential/new owners. Pod-Point offer Type2 (43kW) and CHAdeMO (50kW) charging. I can’t be the only one who assumed type 2 would only be marginally slower than CHAdeMO? However, the Leaf has a maximum of 6.6kW through type 2 (I think). Is this the same or similar for all EVs, or just Nissan? I’m interested, because it’s something I’d consider in a few years when I change cars if, say, other makes can achieve near 43kW charging through type 2.",2020,11,22
"At the risk of sounding a little dismissive...an internet search will quickly tell you what you need to know. The fundamental point is that ac charging requires the on-board charge unit in the car to rectify the input to dc suitable for charging the battery. These on-board charge units have a limited capacity. 7kW is typical, some will do 11kW from a suitable 3-phase charge point. A very small number of cars can support 22kW ac, and as far as I'm aware some models of Renault Zoe are the only ones that can charge at 43kW ac.",2020,11,22
"This can be very confusing and whilst there’s plenty of information out there it’s easy to get things wrong. 
 
A 7kW (32A single phase) onboard charger does currently seem to be the norm and this dictates the AC charge rate on type2. 
 
The Zoe is unusual in its ability to take so much charge current through type 2 and this is all to do with using the motor coils as inductors for the charging circuit which I believe is a unique design. 
 
A 22kW three phase charge point is much cheaper than a CCS rapid but I suspect we’ll increasingly see either 7kW single phase points or rapid chargers.",2020,11,22
"One of the common misconceptions are EV drivers rocking up to a Rapid charger, charging through the AC charger and wondering why they are not seeing 43kW through the charger! As mentioned above, only a handful of EVs are able to rapid charger through the 43kW AC charger - I can only think of one make (first gen Zoes). You should check out all the comments and “complaints” on ZapMap!! 
 
As mentioned, the AC charger rate is limited to the onboard charger - most have a 7kW onboard charger, so the maximum you will see through the 43kW AC rapid charger is.... 7kW!

"Had a long journey today so charged the car to 100% overnight. My plan was to blast the heating on before I left (with the charger plugged in) to warm the car up. That way I would save wasting battery heating the car after I set off. But it didn’t go to plan! 
 
I turned the heating on but it didn’t feel very warm. It felt like in an ICE car when you try to heat it without the engine on and it’s not very strong. 
 
Problem was I couldn’t turn the car on as it was plugged in. I couldn’t work out how to run it off the charger as the battery was at 100% so couldn’t start a charge. 
 
In the end I unplugged, turned the engine on and the heater warmed up quickly. Then plugged back in to regain some of the 3% I’d lost. 
 
Am I doing something wrong or is there a solution to this? I know you can set a pre-heat temperature and departure time for say 10am but that doesn’t really help as with a small child we never know how long it’ll take to leave! By the time we leave the car would probably be cold again! 
 
Is it possible to heat the car up using the power from the charger 5mins before we set off? Maybe by setting a charge limit of 99% and then heating the car while it charges the final 1%? 
 
Second quick question, is the UVO app incredibly slow for everyone else and takes three or four times to successful send a command to the car?",2020,10,16
"When I was checking the “missing” key fob problem the other day, I noticed that behaviour too. Plugged in and started (you can start the car up, it won’t move obviously) and the HVAC blew fresh air. I’m assuming it won’t heat in this scenario.

"Uvo has got better (faster) for me recently. When I sent an activate HVAC command, it used to report an error but had started. It now reports success.

"I'm not understanding, where is it shown the heat pump runs on 400 volts? Clearly the compressor is a motor, but a 400v motor? 
 
Greg",2020,12,30
"Sorry I don’t have a reference to give you. However it seems pretty clear to me that the HVAC/heat pump compressor could not practically operate from the 12V rail. It will require several kilowatts of power when running at its maximum output. Even if there was enough power constantly available from the 12V rail, it would be quite energy inefficient to do it that way due to the inevitable DC/DC down converter losses, and also the extreme high motor drive currents required would be pretty impractical to achieve at that low supply voltage. 
 
I expect there will be a separate little 3 phase inverter driver running off the HV battery rail which is dedicated to power a fully sealed variable speed synchronous brushless motor integrated scroll compressor unit. That is how Toyota did it in the AC system from the 2003 Prius onwards. I imagine it will be an essentially similar compressor system in the Hyundai/Kia cars. 
 
If you discover otherwise, I’m all ears of course.

"Greg 
Why do you like to intervene and challenge things quite so much? I don’t mind friendly debates as we all try to learn stuff and help each other, but you sometimes become so rude, offensive and come across as being astonishingly arrogant. Frankly, it all stops being fun when this happens. 
 
I normally try to walk away from forum disputes as it’s a road to nowhere. However, as you have asked, I’ll try to respond to your points just this time, but I don’t want to perpetuate this specific aspect of the discussion (as I’m sure others don’t either). I gave my considered opinion, it was clearly not a statement of fact as you suggest. A statement that starts with “It seems pretty clear to me....”is clearly a signal that what follows is statement of opinion. I try to never state things as facts unless I’m extremely confident, or something is clearly an undisputed fact. 
 
I said  several  kilowatts because I freely admit don’t know the actual number. Kia/Hyundai seem very sparing on publishing proper details for everything. However, general engineering experience and some common sense tells me it would have to be quite a significant power otherwise it could not perform it's functions adequately. It is certainly beyond the sensible realms of the 12V rail system in this case (IMHO of course!) 
 
A  DC Brushless motor  is just different words saying essentially the same thing as I described earlier (but with the 3 phase inverter driver built right inside the motor housing, whereas I said “separate“). The net effect is absolutely what I said it  probably  is comprised of. 
 
The KIA hybrid compressor you linked to is a scroll compressor and it does indeed have a HV DC connector at the top left corner of the diagram on the page you linked us to. 
See also here for confirmation (as you seem to believe nothing unless it’s absolutely proven) .......  Kia Niro : Compressor Schematic diagrams : Air Conditioning System  
See connector B. 
It doesn’t state the actual DC Voltage, but I think we can assume it will be whatever the HV battery is on the hybrid car. I also  assume  it will be something quite similar on E-Niro but using a higher Voltage rated brushless motor. 
 
Also see multiple pictures, Orange wires, and references to HV connectors etc here  Kia Niro : Compressor Repair procedures : Air Conditioning System  
 
I completely agree the fuse you found in the cabin marked AC cannot be carrying 400V. However, I suspect that fuse is possibly feeding 12V to the AC cabin fan, air flap servo actuators, HVAC ECU Etc Etc. If there is an actual compressor HV fuse it is likely somewhere inside the main HV inverter, where I  assume  the HV DC power to the compressor is sourced from. 
 
Thats all I’ve got. I still am convinced the heat pump/HVAC compressor in the E-Niro will be powered off the HV battery. That is my opinion anyway. If you want to say I’m “guessing” then so be it. 
 
In future, may I politely suggest that if you wish to disagree with something then fine, but please could you do it with a little bit more respect to others. Referring to a group of fellow forum members (that you never even met) as having “woefully inadequate knowledge”, and grouping folks together and sarcastically implying they are “experts” etc etc is just not very nice. There are much better ways to express your opinions. 
 
Happy new year! 
Peter",2020,12,31
"I genuinely wanted to know how you knew it was 400 volts... 
 
And you made the statement about the kilowatts of energy as FACT to support what you said, which you now admit you have no idea, a GUESS, and your latest response NOW has ASSUME and PROBABLY, and other caveats. 
 
If you had said ""the compressor has a DC high voltage connector"" that would have been fine. 
 
But you based your statement on something you presented as FACT when indeed you were just GUESSING. (power consumption too high for a 12v circuit) 
(btw a 60 amp circuit at 12v is 720 watts enough to run a high efficiency HVAC, as was the case in my Fiat 500e) 
 
That's why I asked the question about where you got your information, and indeed the very thing I asked about YOU MADE UP, IT WAS NOT FACT. 
 
So, I do challenge people when they do this, present their GUESS as a FACT, in my opinion, that is tantamount to lying, after all your posts, i.e. you are not a newbie, nor unintelligent, it's at least deceptive, clearly it was untrue.

After 2023, increasingly the people that have to be persuaded will be people that park on the street or live in an apartment. We need to make the shift in how we promote EVs and make the arguments. 
 
There needs to be a lot more charging points in apartments and for off-street parking. It needs to be very convenient - there needs to be always a charger free when you park the car in the place you park it.

What really needs to be sorted is the current excessive cost of wholesale electricity; that is something that is impacting on the less well-off right now, whereas ""people being forced to buy BEVs"" is a very long way away.

I moved to Cornwall in 2006 from Harlow, Essex, and since then I have noticed that cars are, in general, much older here. There is money here: more so since covid (a lot of people moved here after). But I do feel that in deepest Cornwall... Redruth, Camborne etc, money is tight and there are very few EVs owned by natives. So with that in mind, installing EV chargers could be seen as spending money for the holidaymakers and not for the locals and to an extent I'd agree with that.

Really, though, there are a diverse range of different solutions, and it is hard to predict what will end up working. Charging at supermarkets/shops plus rapids plus work chargers plus parking lots will certainly happen before we get whole terraced streets with regularly spaced chargers, because there isn't the critical mass for that solution, yet. Walking to a local charger worked OK for us, but now charging at work makes things a lot easier.",2023,6,24

The small battery version of the doesnt-exist-yet ID.2 probably has a short range: an existing similar-sized vehicle is the 50kWh Zoe which is pretty much acceptable range-wise.

"My neighbour runs a cable across the pavement to charge his electric black cab. It's done properly with a conduit, but it does mean he has to sometimes ask neighbours to move their cars so he can get back in ""his"" space on the street and charge. As a consequence, we, all his neighbours try to keep out of his way so he can charge after a shift. It's generally visitors and van drivers who seize the opportunity, but the Amazon vans move on pretty quick. 
The council says on its website that you shouldn't run a cable across the pavement to charge, but many people do. It's part of the reality and reaction when there are not enough charge points but people have chosen the EV path. The council can enforce this, but it would be inviting the push-back that they need to provide more conveniently local sockets. 
 
Before I get flamed for justifying laying cables across the pavement (or attacking it!).... My position is that I respect that even a mat or one of those hump-type conduits is not good for wheelchairs, prams, push chairs, a trip hazard etc. I also didn't want to go to the expense of a charge point install to later be told to desist. 
In defence of those who have done otherwise, there are badly maintained foot paths, uneven and large tree-root obstacles, extraneous street furniture etc. plenty of ""obstacles"" greater than a conduit and not attended to. Councils who "" declare a climate emergency "" need to  act  as well as virtue-signalling by otherwise empty pronouncements. 
 
BTW of course I accept the terrible situation councils find themselves in with constrained funds and truly more essential services to try to maintain. There are grants which some council appear not to be taking up at all as far as I can see.",2023,6,25
"I wonder if detachable batteries will ever become a thing for small car EVs (e.g. not just scooters). On short commutes, you don't need that much energy (of course, you still need an onboard battery as well). The big version of the ""suitcase battery"" on the silence scooter is 6kWh.",2023,6,26
"@Ken B   
Don't feed the trolls 👍",2023,6,26
"Agreed, there are a number of factors here though: 
 
 
 Those who can have an EVSE at home should be incentivised to do so, which takes pressure off the public charging 
 LAs should be working out how to use 7kW EVSEs at cheap rates to guide footfall to town centres, or rapid at close to domestic rates (if I can get 29p kWh at Ionity for paying £11.59 per month then that has to be possible, perhaps by linking discounts to council tax accounts?) 
 More needs to be done to increase local supply to aid increased rapid charging 
 More needs to be raised through taxation of EV sales to go towards EVSE development 
",2023,6,26
"I don't think there is a terribly good case for subsidising public EV charging further (charger installation is already heavily subsided already), at the moment. i.e. it makes more sense to see if charging prices fall to more reasonable levels next year, given that wholesale electricity prices may be more normal. As an EV owner without a driveway, I'm much more worried about getting a convenient reliable charge at all, rather than the cost (also, the same subscription that gives me cheap Ionity gives me reasonable-cost AC charging). Would be nice to have lower off-peak prices for public charging, though (like some places in Scotland do at the moment).",2023,6,26
"With local councils doing their best to discourage car usage to reduce congestion using LTNS, congestion charging, ULEZ, cycle paths, 20mph limits, expensive parking, pedestrianisation, public transport, why would they want to install/encourage EV public charging points?

"figs taken from gov docs 
 
26% of dwellings had no designated parking provision at all. 
22% of households do not have a car. 
 
These people just need to swap -only joking. But nevertheless some of this process will take place. EV charging will move up the value chain when moving house and houses without parking will be cheaper and attractive to say students and others who do not need a car as a bicycle etc will do. Others will convert ""the front garden"" to a charging oppurtunity. One sees this happening all the time and this will only increase and so the question is what % of houses could not accomadate charging if needed to. I dont know but perhaps 5% 
 
At work and destination charging will take a large % of those not able to charge at home. Those left over will use a ICE car up to 2050 if a car is even required. 
 
I believe there are/will be better approach than just putting posts along the pavement. If we talk about the etiquette around charging hubs just think of what will happen on the street.",2023,6,27
"Only 10% of households within a 5 minute walk of a local charger is an interesting stat. It would be nice to know the same figure for households without driveways. In a way, that sounds encouraging: only 1% of cars on the road are EVs, and the figure for people without driveways is lower. We need to increase the number of public AC charging points by a huge factor just to meet increased demand as people buy new EVs, which would put chargers near most households without driveways. 
 
In other words, I think people are exaggerating how big a problem this stuff is going to be, and a lot of it will be solved (for most people) just by continuing to roll out more of the same, as demand increases.",2023,6,28
"There are multiple different home charging products on the market.  
 
How do you decide which one is for you?

"When I bought mine, 2013, I took the recommendation from the Energy Savings Trust in Scotland who advised me to approach my electricity supplier to have the charge point installed (Rolec). At the time I did not know there was much by way of choice for units. Next time I would like to go for one with that could be monitored remotely including telling me that the car was plugged in whether or not it was charging.",2018,6,26
"Home charge points are really quite simple. There's a tiny bit of microcontroller, and an electromechanical switch (contactor), and probably some current limiting breaker and earth leakage trip. The most expensive component of it all is actually the EV specific connector, and the cabling. 
My advice is to get something that looks well made, and can handle the current draw of your vehicle. Get the one that won't look out of place on your house. 
If you have local generation, or local home battery energy storage, get one that can monitor your home's energy usage and signal to the vehicle to slow down or speed up the charge rate. 
If you're going for a tethered charge point, remember that not all vehicles have the european standard type 2 vehicle inlet, and older Leafs and similar use type 1 connectors. 
 
I got a Rolec, because at the time (3.5 years ago), it was the cheapest that could do 7kW. It's also reasonably easy to maintain by any electrician due to mostly containing standard components should the need arise.",2018,6,26
"In my previous house, I went for something that I liked the look of - in that case an ABL. I particularly dislike the look of Rolecs, so avoided that. Given all the burnt-out RCDs, that seems like it was a good decision. 
 
This time I didn't care about looks, but I wanted the adaptive charge rate of the Zappi. I also like the import limit feature, if I get a second EV so need two charge points. 
 
Price wasn't so much of a consideration, but I think the OLEV grant (and the EST top-up in Scotland) distorts the pricing anyway, so a lot of options coincidentally cluster around the same 'maximising the grants' price. I certainly enjoyed the quote for something like £994 when it was £500 OLEV + £500 EST funding...",2018,6,26

I would defiantly look for a smart or smarter charger 2nd time round.",2018,6,27
"First is reach given my drive. With the other car on the drive and the Ampera last as I leave early I needed 8.5 metres of cable with a type 1 plug. This ruled out all the tethered ones at the time. Probably still does. There were few options then the ex bg chargemasters turned up on eBay cheap, 1 16A untethered later and a spark to do the work/paperwork. 
Cheaper than the overpriced olev install which I feel causes the prices to rise by 300+ over the real cost. 
Not the best looking, these days I'd have an EO one very neat and attractive. The Anderson ones look good but are not suitable for my use (length) 
The option to use a type 2 connector will I expect be needed if we get another ev, Swimbo is after a Baker or a Fiat 500e, I do intend to hang on to the Ampera though so will (hopefully) need both.

1. Myenergi say the Zappi takes excess solar power. Isn't that what all electrical appliances do? Eg i wait u til 11 am on a sunny day to put the dishwasher on, as it should take the power from the PV first. Why wouldn't any charger work that way?

"Zappi monitors house use and solar generation. If there is more than 1.6kW of power it will switch on, if power drops down it switches off on Eco +, on Eco it charges at 1.3kW but ramps up if more solar power available, on Fast at 7 kW. I am at home mostly so plug in, set to Eco+ and it charges when power available. In autumn. I will move to Eco and take advantage of any power.",2018,7,6
"Speakeasy, the charging specs allow the current offered to the car to be set in fractions of an amp, from 6A upwards. So the Zappi tracks your current use trying to use up all the exportable electricity, and ramps the car current up & down accordingly in fine steps. Dishwashers etc will generally draw a steady current, with sudden jumps as heaters go on & off. Zappi monitors this and adjusts accordingly. Of course you can tell it to get on & charge as fast as possible, if you want.",2018,7,6
"Great, thanks so much.",2018,7,7
"I think others have pretty much covered the Zappi but I will add that in just over two months of EV ownership, I am yet to pay for any electricity using eco+ mode. I do not expect this to be the case in the winter months but you need to exploit what you can from solar.

"What enticed you all to buy an electric vehicle in the first place? 
Looking into my newborn neice's eyes for the first time, I had an epiphany that is probably familiar to all parents. Suddenly nothing else mattered, nothing but that beautiful, innocent girl. For the first time, I saw clearly how wasteful my lifestyle was, and how much harm I was doing to the world she was going to grow up in. Shortly after, I sold my diesel car and bought a bicycle. 15 years later, I find I'm in need of a car again, and I won't even consider anything that makes the world worse.

"Happy to reply but it's a bit holistic - since I'm still awaiting my own car, but have active use of its slightly larger cousin. 
 
 
What enticed you all to buy an electric vehicle in the first place? 
 
Multitude of reasons. I am conscious of my environmental impact in general - I have no children, nor is it likely I'd be able to at least not in an 'easy' way, but nevertheless I do not want to leave a poisoned chalice for those that follow. Besides I've hopefully got a good 50 years left in me therefore it is conceivable I could be around to experience the effects of global warming. Due to mobility issues related to circulation I need an automatic in winter anyway - and I see electrics as the ultimate automatics. Finally, the timing was right. The car I bought was discounted such that it was available at the same price as the top spec petrol automatic of its type. Once parity is reached it's game over for ICE, IMO. Plus I was fortunate to get to break even on the car I owned previously despite only being a year old - used car prices really are mad! You could argue changing is not economically friendly - but the previous car isn't going to landfill it's got a full life ahead of it with someone else. 
 
Whether you were previously an internal combustion engine enthusiast and converted to electric? 
 
An enthusiast of sorts. I'm a motorcyclist, in the blood, and have ridden and driven since the day I was old enough to. I don't particularly want speedy cars or modified ones though I have an appreciation for the marvels we as beings are capable of producing. 
 
Which features you love about your electric vehicle and which you dont? 
 
 
 Driving experience. For those of us who havent been able to have premium badge stuff an EV version of your every day car is like you've leapt into the future. The silence, smoothness, potency and speed balance out to a feeling of sophistication every day ICE vehicles just can't achieve. Moreover they're so damn relaxing they take so much stress out of driving. I find myself driving much more sedately and considerately at the wheel of an EV somehow. 
 Running costs. Even with electricity on the rise EVs are cheaper to run for me, and by an order of magnitude. 
 Power. What's not to love about a small Vauxhall hatchback that can 0-60 in about the same time as a 1970s Ferrari can (the Dino was the yardstick I picked at random). 
 home charging. A petrol station in your garden? fantastic. 
 
 
 Out and about charging is still a bit ropey. It's getting much much better but it requires some forethought and planning that some people just arent willing to give yet. 
 Unless you go to a marque that's largely staked its future on EV, or has bought into it early like Nissan or Tesla, many dealers are a bit clueless about EVs. 
 List prices are high. Discounts go some way to alleviate this but the costs are still a long way from 'reasonable'. 
  
Is there a big electric car modifying scene, including car meets/ racing etc? 
 
Fully Charged is the only big meet I'm aware of and it's more of a hybrid meet/sales pitch convention. Test drives, walk arounds of cars etc. It's a fairly big commercial event. I am not aware of any 'enthusiast' driven meets. In terms of racing I only know of Formula-E which seems a bit dull tbh or the electric off road racing they started a year ago which was cracking fun to watch. Modifying - maybe I'm aging a bit more than my years would warrant but not for me. Modding any of the drivetrain stuff is a recipe for disaster - and given EVs are so dependent on aerodynamics for efficiency I would suggest that body modification wouldn't be beneficial either. We did put a very big subwoofer in the boot of a mk1 Leaf ",2022,3,21
"The range of a vehicle can be an issue. It isn't linear, weather and driving style can make a big impact on range so you do need to be a canny driver. Long journeys can be like a Formula 1 race, how many pit stops do I want. Do I drive quickly and stop an additional time or do I take it easy and drop speed to 60 mph and avoid a stop? 
 
Because EVs are very efficient the drop in range is much more noticeable. But for those of us that drove in the 60s, a mini had a 4 gallon tank so a range of about 160 miles. Petrol stations were staffed and closed early except on some of the major roads. Few motorways existed so few 24/365 petrol stations and there were no big supermarkets with fuel stations. I don't remember doing overnight journeys but I regularly drove London to the North West and would leave it no later than 21:45 to fill my tank.",2022,3,21

Whilst EV's certainly aren't carbon neutral they certainly reduce pollution in our cities which has to be a good thing health wise,2022,3,23
There is also a very good argument that we aren't producing local emissions in our towns and villages and that electric cars are quieter which again benefits our local environment. It's not entirely about CO2 although that is the bit that has the biggest effect on the planet.,2022,3,23
"What enticed you all to buy an electric vehicle in the first place? 
 The deciding factor was visiting our family in the USA the same day they purchased a Tesla end 2017 and then being loaned another by the nearest Service Centre Ranger for me to drive the entire duration of the four week holiday. We already had solar panels & battery storage & could not use much of the exported excess for many months of the year so an EV was a logical choice (even after purchasing one EV, plenty of excess solar still applied so we now have two (Model 3 and Fiat 500e)).  
 
 Whether you were previously an internal combustion engine enthusiast and converted to electric? 
No interest in cars whatsoever but I have always been keen on technology and also issues with the environment, pollution, recycling, energy & unnecessary waste. 
 
 Which features you love about your electric vehicle and which you dont?  
For both cars: Simple one-foot driving, auto hold when stopping (any gradient), pre-warming or cooling from an app before going out to the car if needed, ease of home charging and extreme low cost ('free' spring-autumn for us), 'self driving' TACC and auto steer on motorways/dual carriageways (better in the Fiat than the Tesla!), pre-accident detection and avoidance, very good battery management and efficiency, acceleration - safe overtaking & performance, lack of servicing requirements, extremely low cost of ownership (accepting we are fortunate enough to be able to own two expensive EVs in the first place of course). Finally, the Tesla gives us the opportunity to drive literally anywhere in the knowledge that the car will direct us to a 100% reliable supercharger when needed and top to full in around 30 minutes, usually less than 15 and quicker than a toilet/coffee break. 
 
There is nothing specific to dislike apart from a few individual quirks of each car that is not EV specific. Neither of us would choose to return to traditional propulsion & as the market expands, volumes will increase & economies of scale/ competition will bring prices down. Based on other technology I also predict that batteries with 1000m range will come within a few years, as will ever reducing charge times.

"Hi All 
 
Im currently looking at getting an EV but im concerned that like much of the scare mongering when arguing against an EV, that theyre nowadays much more an appliance than something that can be driven for pleasure or with the heart.  
 
I purchased a new BMW M3 last October which has become more of a weekend and pleasure motor as I work full time from home and do relatively little mileage. It was one of those purchases having always wanted an M car and I love it to bits. 
 
I will take out my car, purely for the enjoyment of the drive. The enjoyment I get isnt necessarily just about the speed either. Thats just 1 part of it but a combination of several : its the sound, the sumptuous interior with its bucket seats and also built quality and the fact its an M car too. It all adds up to a hugely enjoying experience.  
 
So heres the question, can an EV also make us feel passionate about driving?  
 
Are there many here that literally hit the road in their EVs purely for the pleasure it gives.? 
 
 
You'll have to forgive me this naïve sounding question as I've never driven an EV before so have zero gauge on this, hence my question.   
 
Cheers 
 
Ste",2022,8,27
"I have a Tesla model 3 long range, I drive it every possible time I'm not doing something else and I love it. It's a completely different experience to what you're gonna feel in an M3 but that's not to say it's going to be worse. 
 
I'm a huuuuge fan of the sound of American and German V8 engines, even the old ones, and any time I'm near one I'll stop just to listen to it but I don't feel like I miss an engine note that my car doesn't have. It just depends what you like. And it also depends on the EV. As pokey as an eCorsa is off the line it might not satisfy quite as much as a Porsche Taycan 👍 
 
Point to take away... Go drive some!",2022,8,27
"Many EV drivers say they would not want to go back to ICE, and often one of the reasons is because they are nicer to drive. 
I'm certainly enjoying driving my e-niro. I don't drive purely for driving's sake (never did except when very young and the experience was still a novelty), but often to go to nice places for a walk or a meal out or (as this afternoon) an afternoon pint in a pleasant spot on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales. The fact that I can do so for free (solar electricity) and without excessive noise or pollution definitely adds to the enjoyment.",2022,8,27
We drive from Southampton to Mudeford Quay just for fish and chips and watch the sunset.,2022,8,27
"I’ve had my M3 since 2010. Love it. 
 
I’ve also now got my e-Golf since 2019. Love it. 
 
Obviously both very different and that’s the joy of them for me.",2022,8,27
I didn’t know people burn petrol just for pleasure. That’s news to me. I’m only using my EV to go to a place I have to go. I love my EV and wouldn’t go back to ICE anytime. Love the experience. Looking for my next EV as a second car. MG4 is a prime candidate.,2022,8,27
"I don’t drive for pleasure although if I was back to when I did, I know I would enjoy my EV immensely. Hypothetically, a long rural trip could be done in a leisurely way or with tight cornering, keen overtaking, and keeping as close to 60 as possible. I know my EV would outpace any ICE I had on those sort of trips.  
 
What I do enjoy is any time you are alongside a fossil car - I make judicious use of the accelerator up until the speed limit.",2022,8,27
"I understand your feelings but I think just using a fossil fuel car for pleasure as we have been used to will become more and more an unacceptable thing to do in the way other behaviours have like smoking or drink driving.  
I am not even sure how long they will be useable for the majority of old car collectors albeit museums will no doubt keep some. 
I am certain the future of electric cars will include those cars where the driving characteristics will be honed for the pleasure aspect as with ICE but again using them to their full potential on public roads really is increasingly unacceptable but there must be a huge market for track days as a result.  
The new fangled new tech aspect of BEV does make them fun and I love my EQC and it will soon be a year on from delivery yet it still gives me great pleasure to pull away powerfully and silently from parked. In terms of build etc it is like all my Mercedes’ so no real change there ( Ihad an e class with the full digital screen when they were new) but something like the Tesla which to my eyes seems plasticky and cheap but is appreciated for its minimalist non standard interior design Would I suspect feel veryvery different and probably very modern (ironically to my eyes the interior looks like a cheap 70’s car especially the ghastly steering wheel but that is a very personal and utterly subjective view). 
I think you should just try driving a few different models and then you can really see if they are all the same or if there are differences.",2022,8,27
"Erm, I’m gonna say no. Soz. Ev are very capable and can be a great steer, but in much the same way as film photography and vinyl have very pleasing distortions and an engrossing ritual, I think to a petrol head in an EV, they will miss that ritual and pleasing distortion. 
 
I’ve shed the idea of driving as a hobby, I have too many expensive hobbies. As capable as my car is, it doesn’t excite like my Renault RS did even though on paper the performance is similar (nor did I expect it to). Not because the id is worse, but because it’s quite, because it doesn’t provide feedback, because it is well behaved and doesn’t encourage misadventure.",2022,8,27
"Ideal garage would be; 
 
A comfy car, very efficient and good for commuting; BEV totally and perfectly ideal 
A fast car for a fast drive, could be a classic 
A 4x4 for the zombie apocalypse, could be a classic (old Landy) 
A van or van-like derivative with lots of seats and space for utility applications (tip runs) and active holidays with lots of kit 
A sports bike 
An off road bike 
A touring bike 
 
Complete ....! Have I missed something?",2022,8,27
"All of the above - I would have said that to achieve an exciting, but also controlled ICE like drive in an EV would take significantly more money, certainly second hand - but apparently the E208 peugot is a bit of alright (according to  electrifying.com) - we're still way to early in the EV story for things like pleasure !!",2022,8,27
"No, that would be silly, and childlike, just like your contribution to the thread, which is about having fun in an EV, which is indeed possible. 
 
By the way, I saw a cupra born today - if it hadn't been for the little copper badge, it might as well have been an id3 - didn't realise they were almost identical - I hate that about big group EVs,",2022,9,1
"I’ve been through this and have a slightly different perspective. We have a Tesla 3LR which is an extremely fast and capable car, but not one that I would drive for the sake of it. Until recently I also had a highly modified, fast and fantastic handling MX5, which I regularly drove for the sheer joy of it. The problem I had was that I no-longer felt comfortable with burning fossil fuels, which really took the edge off the fun. I’ve now sold it to fund an electric Mini. Having driven lots of electric cars, it’s the closest I could find to a “proper” sports car in terms of smiles and handling (and importantly, width). I’ll be driving with the windows down to bring a bit of added sensation   There are other fun EVs on the way, but my recommendation is don’t confuse speed with fun, and go with something that will make you giggle. 
 
Incidentally, I’ve got ready access to a Caterham Seven should I feel the need for pure visceral driving experiences, but I haven’t felt the urge all that often.",2022,9,2
"Sunstoner, most people seem to think EVs bring back more pleasure to driving and are nicer to drive. 
Don't take our word for it, do some research of the most likely models and book a few test drives.",2022,9,2
"This isn't particularly fast, but I bet it's fun!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobe_GT100   
 
The most fun I ever had in a car was a rented Mk1 Kia Picanto with an 800cc engine, and tyres as skinny as those on my bicycle. I got that into a perfectly controllable 4 wheel drift at 40mph on a 60mph road, laughing all the way.",2022,9,2
"My usual cruising speed on motor ways used to be around 160km/h (100mph). On country roads I liked to change gears manually and take turns fast. 
Then the police began to make more and more controls, speed cameras were installed and the roads became congested on a regular basis, which made me start to drive mostly at the legal speed limits, if possible. Which meant a maximum of 130km/h in my country (80mph). Nonetheless I still had fun driving like that. 
 
Finally I recently tried the car model I ordered: The Fiat 500e, the first electric car I ever drove. I could drive it for a whole morning. At first I was skeptical of the idea feeling pleasure driving with an ""automatic gear box"", even more trying out the nearly autonomous drive. But it was surprisingly enjoyable, agile while having a calming effect and I'm impressed by the Fiat Co-Driver. Although the thing I enjoyed most was the one pedal drive, a main feature of most BEV which I miss now on my ICE. 
As for now I don't regret my order. 
 
Adding to that: 
Now I drive around on motor ways at a maximum speed of 110km/h (68mph) to get used to my future car, for the sake of trying to squeeze more range out of it. And you know what? I enjoy it. Maybe it's me getting old, but I feel calmer like this at destination while still being able to overtake lorries at a decent speed.",2022,9,2
"No-one has mentioned soft-tops yet ... I did read somewhere that they have suddenly become less popular this year due to the excessive heat, but it is still the case that if I want to drive for real pleasure I'll drop the top and go for a ride on some nice country roads. Doesn't have to be particularly fast. It's an ICE, of course, because there aren't any proper EV soft-tops yet. Where are they?",2022,9,3
maybe the thing with EVs is that the car doesn't add fun on its own; it's up to the driver to be good enough to take the car to it's limits. The only EV so far I've driven that didn't have any fun in it anywhere was the MG ZS !!,2022,9,3
"Fun in an EV is subjective. I can have plenty of fun taking a relaxing zen like drive around country roads in my I-Pace without getting close to speed limits. Or I may want to throw the same I-Pace around B roads in an engaging but safe way. But I do still just take drives for the pleasure of it but it really depends on the car. 
 
I had a Kona EV for a few days and it had no redeeming features IMHO. Performance was just OK, it was uncomfortable, unengaging, unrefined. If it was on my drive it would never EVER be taken out just for a pleasure drive. A perfectly functional car but not a nice car. 
 
This isn’t about I-Pace vs Kona it’s just about pleasurable qualities and the Kona IMHO had none. I had Hyundai Coupe years back and it was great fun to drive. Also test drove a Citroen eC4 recently and it was so comfortable and refined that I could happily see myself going for a relaxing drive for no real reason other than pleasure.",2022,9,3
"I used to be a bit of a boy racer in the past, maybe it’s a combination of advancing age and owning an EV but I have slowed down a lot. I find driving an EV calms down any tendency in me to hurry, I just enjoy a smoother driving experience now.",2022,9,3
"One of the recurring feedback themes I hear from ICE owners considering the move to an EV is the purchase/finance cost. For owners of old petrol/diesels that do high mileage, there is definitely a benefit in switching - and leasing costs + running costs of a new EV can be less overall, eg for someone that dives in excess of 10k miles per year there are a few smaller EVs (VW eUP, Nissan Leaf, Fiat 500e, Renault Zoe, MG5) that can be leased for around the £250pcm mark, but deposits required are still hefty (£1k-£2k).  
 
But.... Many people buy older used cars, often for a few thousand / few hundred pounds.  
 
What brand out there could segway into a cheap, popular EV?  
 
Easyjet? MegaBus(BEV)? Aldi?  
 
Given the huge interest and limited supply of electric cars, it will be many, many years before we get to address this used EV & affordability issue. Maybe decades.",2022,6,27
"There are alternatives.  
The vast majority of people commute under 5 miles to work. How about they use an e-bike, a bog standard bicycle or heaven forbid consider walking. 
Imagine how much road space that would free up for those who genuinely need to drive, rather than making motoring the de-facto choice for every journey. 
Hopefully a move to EV's and continuing supply chain constraints will force us to reconsider what is important in our daily lives as I doubt anyone enjoys sitting in traffic jams for a couple of hours a day. 
It's now or never if we are serious about turning the tide against run away CO2 emissions. An EV hardly scratches the surface of what we actually need to do.",2022,6,27
"I hope that you are right but many people juggle school runs, shopping, work and their car is the most flexible way to navigate. 
 
If there is to be a sea-change then it has to be led by policy that is fair to all. Car-free city centres is a start. Create safer public spaces, make cities enjoyable for pedestrians and active travel",2022,6,27
"If your question is, who will provide the first really cheap EV, to me it looks likely it will be either Dacia or one of the Chinese manufacturers. 
But of course, it'll only be when supply and demand balance out that we see a second-hand EV market that offers prices comparable to second-hand ICE. And that's probably ten years away. 
 
The likes of xbus (which I've recently discovered, but can't see becoming a reality), the Citroen Ami and others provide an alternative to a full car that might create a new market.",2022,6,27
"The Ora is hardly affordable. £30k and less than 200 miles WLTP. A far cry from the £20-25k and 250 mile WLTP that was touted. 
MG have it about right IMO, and the MG4 could be an affordable EV supermini when it arrives, if they can get it into the £20-25k bracket.",2022,6,27

"Drove my GTE for the last time today. The 4yr lease is now up and it will sit on the driveway until the leaseco can come to get to it.  
So it's going to tease me ....  
A big thank you to all those who answered my Qs, helped with tips of their own or just brighten our days with their wise-cracks and gentle side digs.  
I am going to really miss the temptation of pressing the GTE button, of pressing the Climate OFF button, and of the course the temptation of changing the GOM display for the trip distance. Been there, got several tee-shirts, and spent way too many hours trying to get the electrons to last as long as possible. 
It's been a fab car that I have REALLY enjoyed having. I wanted the drop the household fuel bill as the main getting-reason, and it did that on the 50k miles I put on it, saved us loads, helped by at least half my charging being at freebies in the local area/workplace.  
 
We'll drop to a single car household for the next few months.  
My employer has decided to cancel its own car scheme I was in , so deciding now about whether to get a secondhand BEV or lease small new(without a deposit). c19 and other life events now mean a different strategy likely, but I am looking sideways at the coming Fiat 500e.  
 
Going to be a cold winter without preheat, I know it !!!",2020,4,9
Hopefully you will be back soon ,2020,4,9
"Thanks for all your advice and thoughts in the last years! 
 
My 3 year lease expires in August and wonder how many more times I will get to drive the GTE before then...! I have an e-Niro on order but C19 has hit my business very hard and I may end up having to decline the car in August. However, we are a one car household and need a car really, so worry I may end up needing to go back to a cheap second hand petrol car to cover us in the short term...  First world problems though. 
 
Stay safe and well and hope you get the EV you want!",2020,4,10
"Hi  @gladini  . 
I was also sorry to see my GTE drive off into the distance, late last year. 
We also dropped down to a single car for a few months. 
I quickly found when driving the wife's Fiat 500 that it proved to be more expensive on fuel costs after the fugal GTE. 
Having owned 3 other previous versions of the Golf, I found the GTE was by far the best model with regards to power and economy.  
All the other models where great, but the electric drive in GTE put it right at the top of the pile. 
In only a few short months or ownership, I just knew that my next car would have to be a full BEV.  
I think you may have probably come to the same conclusion by know. 
I still drop by the GTE forum on a regular basis. 
Noticed a lot of the early adopters of the GTE have moved across to BEV's.  
A lot of forum members have greatly benefited from your questions and comments over the time you have spent here. 
Good luck on your choice of car after the GTE. 
I know I have said this before, but the GTE is hard act to follow.

"Tesla head count cut: 
 Tesla cuts jobs as cars 'too expensive'  
 
I think there may be a demand problem for the M3, people who can afford and want the more expensive variants have mostly bought them, opening demand to Europe has not seen a huge demand for the expensive models as people all think the cheap one is coming fairly soon and having already waited 2 years, what is another 6 months? 
 
So Tesla actually needs to build and be profitable on the 35k base m3 if it wants to move the metal and at the moment it looks like profitability at that level is difficult but the alternative is accepting lower volumes and again in the car industry that also leads to losses as assets are under-utilised. 
 
What they need of course is a product line that includes SUVs and pickups at all price points but these are not online yet. Can tesla finance the development of these new products to production if the legacy models are not generating any profits? Also the odds are they won't hit the market before VW start producing EVs in some volume so there won't be the 'there is no other EV choice' premium that they have exploited for the M3. 
 
So in summary, Q4 should have seen another good profit same as Q3, Q1 should see a some profit depending on EU and China demand but Q2 onwards things look pretty lean.",2019,1,18

"Hi everyone, 
 
for my Design class I wanted to conduct a study about EV charging and its future prospects in the UK. While reading related articles was interesting I would love to get some insight from people with firsthand experience, so I would really appreciate your help! This short questionnaire's aim is obviously not to provide a complete picture, I would just like to gain an understanding from the actuals user's perspective, so I'm happy for every kind of input you can give me! 
What I find particularly interesting is how charging services funtion is more rural areas and how they can help tackle (irrational?) concerns like range anxiety. Thanks in Advance! 
 
 
 Where do you normally charge? (private/public/work/…) Why? 
 What type of charging do you prefer? (standard/fast/rapid/…) Why? 
 Are there specific providers you prefer? If so, why? 
 What do you do while waiting?  
 Do you live in an urban or rural area? What are the major differences you see between those areas?  
 What do you think could improve your charging experience? 
",2019,10,23
"
 Home...because it's at home. 
 Standard 7kW...because that's what I have at home 
 My own charger, because it's cheaper than anything else and at home. 
 I get on with my life. 
 I'm in a Semi-urban area. Urban areas are going to need far more options for charging. In particular places where a car can be left for an extended period to charge. Not rapid chargers. 
 On the rare occasion that I am using rapid chargers, then the main gripe is poorly maintained stations at locations where there's only one charger. 
 Honestly, I don't think your survey is particularly imaginative, and isn't going to get to the heart of the issues you're trying to identify. 
 
The thing with EV ownership is that it's a different mindset to a fossil fuelled car. If (and currently it's an important ""if"") you are able to charge at home, the only time you care about public charging is if you are doing a journey which is further than half your range away from your home. So as long as you've bought an appropriate car for your life-style (e.g. don't buy a Fiat 500e if you have a 40 mile each way commute) the vast majority of your journeys don't involve public charging. You don't wait for charging because the charging is done while you're sleeping. 
 
This is in direct contrast to fossil fuelled cars where ""public"" refuelling stations are a fact of life, and it's convenient if there's one 5 minutes down the road. With an EV the charging stations I care about are the ones about 100 miles away from me, as those are my springboard to the rest of the country, or last stop before the leg home. 
 
What I think you'll see is a growth in ""motorway services"" businesses into more diverse retail outlets where people can spend time whilst charging built around large arrays of chargers, and a huge shrinkage in the ""local petrol station"" type business that are currently every 5-10 minutes along our roads. 
 
Also, on the Rural vs Urban point you raised. Have a look at home many places you can buy petrol north of Loch Ness (Google maps will do this). Now look at  a charger map  for the same area (similar count if not more). ...and then think about being about to recharge your vehicle on your own land and the liberation that brings. Not having to do a 70-80 mile round trip to fill the car up each week. My first taste of range anxiety was driving a diesel through the Scottish highlands, because once I was past Inverness... that was pretty much it.",2019,10,23
"
 Where do you normally charge? (private/public/work/…) Why? 
 a car-park near my wife's work, at a local Tesco (formerly a local car part, but currently being redeveloped. (we do not have off-ropad parking) 
 
 What type of charging do you prefer? (standard/fast/rapid/…) Why? 
 I would like a local rapid, so we could do a ""weekly charge"" in an hour while doing something else. The work car-part is not very convenient, and tesco has 7kw cahrhers and a 2-hour limit, so we would need two sessions for a weeks change. 
 
 Are there specific providers you prefer? If so, why?

 Public and and home. 
 Rapid if too far from home, at home I suppose you could class it as 'standard'. 
 Charge Place Scotland as they are the 'Operators' of the vast majority of the units in Scotland. 
 At a rapid I will stay with the car and either browse on my phone or watch Netflix in the car. 
 I live in a small town, the major differences I see is that there is only one rapid charger in the town and the next one is over 8 miles away. There are four twin outlet fast chargers spread out in the town but two of these are in use by NHS pool cars and four are at a local hotel so may well be removed from public use once the minimum time period of the installation grant has expired. In an urban area there would be a larger number of chargers within the same area and there could be more choice of operators. 
 Multiple unit locations with more than one rapid charger and several fast chargers as back-up in the event of an issue with the rapid. In future it should be mandatory to have a percentage of spaces in any car park fitted with a minimum of 3kW destination chargers.

"1. 99% at home. I have slow-charging Rex Ev, so long trips mean petrol is used for those. 
2. 7kW wall charger at home, but mostly using 6A granny charger as that suits solar panel array outputting 1.5kW predictably, up to 4kW at very max output. 
3. No. Have used Polar instant, but the app is a real hassle, sometimes charge starts ok, but end up phoning helpline to disconnect!!! 
4. Sleep/other daily tasks, as this is a background activity that costs me very little delays. 
5. City edge. Means I can afford house with driveway, a rare luxury in urban city centres, so home charging is a no-brainer. 
6. Purchase of e.g. Mazda MX-30 Rex will mean I have 120 mile Ev range not present 45, fast charging capability (none at present), and Rex will give me backup in case no chargers available. So this particular car looks to be an excellent advance on the Ampera, which in itself has been the best thought-out ""compromise"" hybrid Ev since 2012. With this car, I will be able to do more like 90% of my trips electrically .vs. 50% today, and I will have 100% charger-independence if I want that. I will be able to ignore destination chargers that require apps/hassle to operate or are overpriced per kWh, similarly I could avoid all Rapids that I consider inconvenient/overpriced. This Ev will get me just-about the best of all worlds. So expect the variety of Evs available to increase, leading to maybe  less  commercial-charger-dependency per Ev than we have today.",2019,10,24

 Where do you normally charge? (private/public/work/…) Why? 
 At home overnight. At the shopping centre in the nearby town. Occasionally elsewhere 
 
 What type of charging do you prefer? (standard/fast/rapid/…) Why? 
 Overnight is fast at 16 amp. I have a PHEV so I can use petrol but avoid it if I can. Occasionally use a rapid. 
 
 Are there specific providers you prefer? If so, why? 
 My home charger is PodPoint as is the shopping centre. No other preference apart from not using a subscription service. 
 
 What do you do while waiting? 
 Sleep, Shop. I stay with the car when I use a rapid. 
 
 Do you live in an urban or rural area? What are the major differences you see between those areas? 
 Rural. Local journeys tend to be further than in an urban area. The 'nearby town' is 14 miles away. 
 
 What do you think could improve your charging experience 
 Payment by contactless credit card.",2019,10,25
"Where do you normally charge? (private/public/work/…) Why? 
 
At home but with the car we use, we benefit from free use of Polar chargers and since we make regular trips to locations featuring these, the charging is often done whilst we eat, shop - and it is free.  
 
What type of charging do you prefer? (standard/fast/rapid/…) Why? 
 
Depends on why we are charging. If a long, beyond range trip, then a rapid is the only choice mid journey. If its at home whilst we sleep I really have no need for rapid. 
 
Are there specific providers you prefer? If so, why? 
 
Polar/Chargemaster - simply because they have more chargers than anyone else. Whilst it does not cost us anything, the polar subscription model - using a provided smart card, if very reliable. 
 
What do you do while waiting? 
 
Have not had to wait in 7 years and 100,000 miles. We are either sleeping, using a restroom, eating or shopping 
 
Do you live in an urban or rural area? What are the major differences you see between those areas? 
 
Urban, edge of a City. Not sure what you are angling at here. I think distances to population centres increase, roads can become poor. I suppose the biggest difference for driving is possibly a long drive to a petrol station vs the ability to charge at home, if you live there. 
 
What do you think could improve your charging experience? 
 
A more reliable charger operator on the motorway network. Whilst we have not had many issues, I know many others have.",2019,10,26
"
 Where do you normally charge? (private/public/work/…) Why? 
 At home. That is the main idea of EVs. 
 
I also charge at 'known' rapid chargers along regular longer distance routes, which I have developed a 'routine' for breaking up the journey so it is virtually zero inconvenience. (i.e. picking the right distance/timing for a comfort break, etc). 
 
There are also occasions where I am going elsewhere and do not know the layout of rapid chargers. This is a terrible experience full of careful planning and guesswork, with multiple back up plans required to avoid being left for the flat-bed to rescue you. The disposition of rapid chargers is too disperse and misplaced to be any sort of substitute for 'random petrol stations' when out and about. 
 
I never use anything but rapid chargers away from a domestic charge point. 
 
 What type of charging do you prefer? (standard/fast/rapid/…) Why? 
 Inductive chargers. Well .... I will one day ..... 
 
But as above, there is no point NOT charging at home if you are there, and there is no alternative but rapid chargers out and about. Rapids need to be on main road routes and provide some basic facilities. 
 
 Are there specific providers you prefer? If so, why? 
 I currently have a Polar subscription but with the new price changes it is going to become not cost effective to continue. The best quality chargers are InstaVolt, but the bays are a bit squashed together in locations not idea for going to charge 
 
 What do you do while waiting? 
 I always try to stop as part of a plan, doing something else, such as a bathroom break or taking a snack. Again, InstaVolts are usually a bit shyte at this. The 'Bannatyne' locations they are often at they don't let you use the toilets and only let you buy their overpriced coffee or such very begrudgingly.  
 
 Do you live in an urban or rural area? What are the major differences you see between those areas? 
 None. Charging away from home is only relevant to rapid chargers, on main roads, for which there is no difference where you live (unless you are so rural you have no electricity!?!) 
 
 
 
 What do you think could improve your charging experience? 
 
 
 A properly integrated rapid network, 
 well placed on main road network, 
 enough of them 
 some of them should be within a pre-bookable service function 
 some of them (not pre-bookable, ad hoc, use on arrival) should have 20 min maximum charge periods 
 with minimum service agreements that you can get compensation/sue the charging company if they fail to perform (e.g. it isn't working and you are then destined for a recovery truck ... for which currently it is 'tough luck' which is utterly ridiculous state of affairs ... at the moment your whole day can be b***gered up and they just tell you 'oh, thanks for letting us know it isn't working' and you have no recourse at all to their incompetencies) 
 automatic car recognition and auto account deductions when plugging in 
 properly policed charging bays, preferably behind security barriers that are ANPR linked to open for EVs only.

 Where do you normally charge? Home, convenience and cost (cheap economy 7 tariff) , occasionally on public network if I have to or if I have free supercharger miles. 
 What type of charging do you prefer? Home on a 7kw charger, because of convenience and 7h cheap charging is more than enough. 
 Are there specific providers you prefer? Tesla superchargers, because of charge speed and pretty good availability. Although I've just rejoined Polar, because they have a charge point near me and I'm currently running two EVs from one charge point at home. 
 What do you do while waiting? - NA most of the time as I'm asleep at home. On superchargers I'll nip to the loo and watch Netflix or catch up on E-mail. 
 Do you live in an urban or rural area? What are the major differences you see between those areas? Edge of a town, not really urban or rural. From my experience a few more rapid chargers in urban areas, but most rapids tend to be near motorways, meaning both rural and urban car park chargers tend to be 3 or 7kw. 
 What do you think could improve your charging experience? 
 More over stay fees to prevent bay hogging.  
 Better availability integration into cars (I headed towards a Supercharger with 3 out of 6 bays free on Friday, when I arrived there 15 minutes later they were all taken, had I known I would have continued on to next one) 
 Following on from above, wouldn't it be great if you could pre-book or reserve a bay for say 15 minutes in advance of arrival so you could be confident that there would be a free bay. If someone wants to use it before then, thats fine, as long as the charger alerts them that they will need to move on soon when the booker arrives, like someone else sat in a reserved seat on the train. If you don't turn up within a margin of your booking time you get a fine to avoid abusing the system availability for others.

 Where do you normally charge? Home, because it's a local runabout.  
 What type of charging do you prefer? For charging in public outside of home range: Rapid, because it's easist, don't have to plan for length of stay.  
 Are there specific providers you prefer? Doesn't matter, as long as they take contactless payment. I prefer location with large  number  of chargers and high  reliability . Tesla superchargers are the perfect model for how to do rapid charging.  
 What do you do while waiting? I sleep while charging at home. I'd use facilities while rapid charging. Rapid charging is quick, instead of stop for 10min break, I'd take 20min break, not a big deal.  
 Do you live in an urban or rural area? Urban  
What are the major differences you see between those areas? Rural will still work with EV, no difference. My parents live in rural area, they are considering an EV.  
 What do you think could improve your charging experience?  
 MORE  chargers at each location, queuing 40min to use the charger for 20min sucks. Contactless payments should be standard by now.  
Better educate people of their car charging charactorist. What's the point of hogging a charger to get last few %? Charge tapering need to be clearly explained and charging cost need to increase to deter people from doing this. (eg. time-based fee structure)

"There is only one thing that bothers me and that is reliability. Having travelled many miles and finding a charger station not working is a BIGGY. Unfortunately there are far to many cases of this and one is always on edge just like when running close on petrol and finding a station run out. 
 
i cannot praise Zap map enough for without them we would struggle. One weakness of Zap map is that users are quick to complain but slow to say it is working and more importantly on which charger type. 
 
EG Yesterday i was monitoring a charger in Exeter, a single one so the location is either on or off. In the morning Zap maps showed it as being out of order but then someone charged on it for 44mins and then it showed out of order but later someone else charged for 30mins. Now it shows working. How much would you depend on such a charger or Zap map reporting. Imagine depending on petrol stations being like that.",2019,10,28

3. A lot of non-EV drivers remain unconvinced about the switch 
4. EV drivers overwhelmingly say they would never go back to ICE 
5. EVs are nice to drive (the journalist said this) 
6. The government has failed to invest properly in charging infrastructure and is leaving it to private business to sort out the issues 
7. The UK is lagging behind other major countries on EV infrastructure 
8. The UK is losing out in the race to manufacture EVs 
9. Councils are not stepping up to help EV drivers without a driveway 
10. The EV switch is inevitable. Manufacturers are only planning for new EV models not ICE 
11. The government needs to step up if we are to meet the 2030 deadline. It set a deadline but is not taking the actions needed to meet it

Its then on the tax payer and people who dont drive. Did they build the petrol station network? Certainly local councils should be pragmatic and make on street parking possible through sensible regulatory changes and simple solutions (charging for conduit channels for ev chsrge cables etc. 
 
If the big car makers actually invested in their own charging networks instead of acting like paracites relying on handouts from the government and Tesla to do their job for them there would not be a problem.

The interview with the boss of Moto was interesting saying how they would love to get more chargers but the Government and DNO's are slow at putting in enough electicity capacity. 
 
I could see how someone new to charging would find it a problem to download lots of apps and get them to work, for balance he could have added that lots of chargers now work with contactless payment.

All I want is to rock up to a charger, flash my card and get on with it. I know that new installations should, by law, all take credit and debit card, so this is a move in the right direction, but there is still a long way to go. On the few occasions that I do need to charge away from home I simply use ZapMap to find chargers that do take plastic and use them.

Yes, the bit at 07:00 where presenter states ""An Ultra Rapid charger can fully charge your vehicle in under an hour"" (!! don't get me started...) and continues ""but most of them are slower than that"". Not  too  far out so far... 
 
All the time he's using what LOOKS like a Rapid, but it isn't, it's a 22 kW Destination charger at Chipping Norton New Street. He's maybe got a 7kW single phase charger in the car? or is it 11 kW 3-phase maybe? 
later edit: Buzz is 11kw 3ph (so he's getting around 3.5 miles/kWh. Thx guys). 
 
He continues ""so to get an extra 38 miles for this car I've got to sit here for an hour. So if I wanted to fill it up up from that port then I'd have to sit here I reckon for another 3 hours. Errm... it's not that good."" 
 
IMHO this is  utterly  and  deliberately  misleading. General public aren't going to know that this  happens  to be a rather rare destinaton charger that has supplied cable & plug (a good thing imho) that  happens  to resemble a Rapid very closely! If he'd used a destination charger and plugged in his own cable, the difference  might  have become a bit suspicious!   
 
There is no explanation/distinction made between the utterly different use-cases of Rapid vs destination charging, and this particular section appears  deliberately  designed to imply that Ev charging is incredibly slow! 
 
I think BBC need to publish a correction to that section, and I've told them so. 
 
Later he manages to use a Gridserve, and is very upbeat about the high speed he's managed to get! See 11:02 minutes in. No attempt at any time to explain/describe the huge discrepancy in previous charging speeds! 
 
Lots of other very negative stuff, poor choice of interviewees - van driver with insufficient range saying Evs are rubbish? Ev vans might be, I don't drive them. Horses for courses, he chose the wrong horse. Etc. 
 
Interviewee saying general public can't afford Evs at avg price £40K? MG 4 available new <£25K, PCPs and total cost of ownership not discussed at all, overall a rather poor program despite many genuine issues being touched on. 
 
I'll post the gist of the reply I get from BBC, as & when it appears...",2023,6,13

"I'm going to stick my neck out here with my first post on this forum and say that that the program was a fair representation of the majority of people in the UK. Most people are expecting lots of applications to be needed, charging hell, complication of using an electric car and high costs. The BBC program agrees with all of this. 
 
If ICE cars were not polluters then most people would never change to Electric propulsion. 
If running an Electric car was as simple as running an ICE at the same cost then I suspect that many people would be happy to make the switch. 
 
From an electric car owners perspective 
 
 There are not enough rapid chargers at service stations. (You need to be able to just stop when you need a pee and charge not hold the pee until you get to a service area that has chargers) 
 The cost for charging is not clear like it is when you go to a fuel station (and varies considerably) 
 Chargers on different networks are different enough to confuse people on the steps to get charging 
 Credit/Debit card should be the easiest option for every charger and the cost to charge should not be worse using this method than other payment methods 
 Dealers haven't got a clue and don't help owners with how to have the most pain-free experience 
 Charging speed and Range when cold is significantly compromised and because of the lack of rapid chargers this makes the situation harder 
 Charging is fastest when the car battery is close to depleted and the car is warm (just how many people know this and why should the average person need to know!) 
 Supermarkets should have loads of 7/11kw chargers so people can charge when doing the shopping. (perhaps 100 of them at each major store) 
 In-car mapping systems show available charging points and this no. included ChadMo when the car can only use CCS. (you think there are 12 chargers to find there are only 6) 
 Stop with all the Phone Apps. I use RFID card or Credit Card everywhere (except the one time I used Tesla) 
 This is summed up by the fast that my wife in 13 months electric car ownership has  never  taken the car somewhere when she knows she would need to charge when out and about. 
 
IMHO opinion, 3 immediate things need to change 
 
 An absolutely massive and rapid increase of rapid chargers, I'm talking 20-30 rapid chargers per motorway service station and every Shell/BP etc fuel station should start introducing 2 or more by the end of the year. 
 Credit/Debit card should become the default option for charging 
 Once the above are in place, a communication campaign to allay peoples fears 
 Yes I agree we need to have our own manufacturing and recycling facilities in the UK but that's another discussion.",2023,6,13
"The fact that many people can charge at home changes the dynamic somewhat. It mitigates the rapid prices - I probably wouldn’t pick by price as its only maybe 5% of my charges in a year so makes almost no difference to overall cost. Very different if you don’t have home charging 
 
Agree that we need more chargers, agree they should be more similar in terms of how they’re used - I expect that’ll settle in time and less important than other factors.  
 
The fear is something that needs to be overcome -perhaps deliberately going for a longer trip along with your wife and checking options along the way. If you can find 1-2 decent hubs (somethign with 4+ at least from a reliable brand) and practice you should be ok.",2023,6,13

Yeah alright a 5 year old Golf diesel might be cheaper to buy but what of the inevitable expensive repair bills? Dual mass flywheel, EGR valve, DPF, depending on the model the auto gearboxes with the dry clutch made of cheese. The servicing costs, the ever rising cost of fuel. As more and more clean air zones come in I can’t see it being long before more of them penalise ever newer cars.

"Second hand Ioniq instead?  
 
The cheap ICE could easily cost £5-£8 a trip in clean air charges which is a lot per month. Plus 50 mpg at £9 a gallon isn't cheap. I'd think fuel prices are easily going to stay above £8 a gallon. 
 
Electricity prices are likely to fall back as there is far too much household pressure to let them just spiral any more. Also with more and more renewables there really is no excuse for it being so expensive.

The move towards EVs must allow for those people... at the moment even used EVs are too expensive for them to buy regardless of what they might save in running costs. It is no good saying they could save on fuel and servicing etc if they can't afford to buy it in the first place.

Automakers, fossil fuel, and media companies are doing everything to slow down and even limit the EV movement by manipulating price and availability.

I have been researching other options.  
 
A small 125cc to 300cc motorbike. A Honda CB125F is about 110mpg-UK. The larger BMW G310R is around 80mpg. The Honda is £3000 new and the BMW £4900. Fuel costs would be around 10p/mile or less. CO2 is roughly half of a small petrol car. The BMW can haul a fair amount of cargo. 
 
An EV scooter. Typically £2000 with a top speed under 40mph and range around 40 miles. You get what you pay for, but it is a cheap alternative to the bus. 
 
An EV maxi scooter or motorcycle. ~£12,000 Top speed over 75mph. Range around 80 miles. BMW CE 04 and Zero FX-E are two examples. 
 
For comparison, Debbie's little Mazda 2 costs her about 15p/mile for fuel at current prices. A used one would be around £10,000.

Fixed cost motoring with no surprises as they do the maintenance, insurance etc. It's one month upfront for the deposit as well which is quite good. That's for 1000 miles a month. Cazoo seem generous and I do wonder how long these prices will last.

"I've been thinking the same thing - my lease is up in 2024 and there is a real possibility that

B. The rate of BIK increases substantially causing a large increase in tax 
C. The lead time on a new car exceeds the 6 months between ordering and giving back the current car leaving me without a car 
D. Silly amounts of VED start being introduced for EVs 
 
If any of those things becomes true then I'll be straight out buying a very old ICE for as cheap as possible that is big enough to fit 4 people, medical equipment and a wheelchair.

I can also see that as you said, there probably aren't huge amounts of the bigger nastier cars around, but surely banning those would be a statement that the UK is serious about stopping emissions.

"TL;DR:  Need an EV for 2 years until Model 3. i3 depreciates extraordinarily in this country. There's a totalled and repaired 2015 fullly loaded for great price. There doesn't seem much damage for it to be totalled. Should I go for it? I want to lose as little money as possible since this capital will be some of late 2018 Model 3 as well. 
 
Hello all; 
 
I am from Turkey. Here, EVs are not really known. Our cumulative full BEV sales are barely 1000, ever. So EV consciousness is really bad despite its tax advantges. (3-15% purchase tax vs. 90-180% purchase tax + no annual tax) 
 
Since 2014 BMW could only sell around 120-150 BMW i3s.(most marketed EV here, ever. Also we only have BEV as REx is 60% tax = ridiciolous price)  
 
We also don't have leasing, PCP like you guys do so depreciation is ""CRAZY"" and buying is the only option. As for me I'm an EV enthusiast and I know a lot about them. Been blogging, organising communities, engaged in charging accesory resale etc. past 2 years. I'm also a Model 3 reservation holder, not expecting delivery until early 2019 for this part of the world. So until then, I need a car. I don't want to go ICE again so I'm looking for a BMW i3 as I really like it after the test drive. 
 
The new 94Ah would do wonders as it can charge three phase as well (pretty abundant here) but the price is 52k €. A lot, when you consider how much it will depreciate. 
 
As for used i3s prices are fairly reasonable but still used market is really slow for it. When you consider there was barely 140 or so i3s sold ever and 26 of them are on sale in the used market thins are looking rough. 2014 basic BEV goes for around 28k €, whereas 2015 fully loaded with heat pump, moon roof etc. go for 35k €. Still a lot. Also these are listings I'm talking about, often no one even calls or asks for 3-4 months. Really slow market. I don't know what the value will be late 2018 when there are 200 mile EVs all around. Especially in this EV ignorant market. 
 
That brings us to this specific 2015 car. Seller (a gallery) is giving me the final price of 23k €. It is a 2015, fully loaded very nice car. Only problem is, it was declared totalled after an accident. Gallery bought from auction and repaired by a body shop. (not BMW itself) Seller shared the pictures of it right after the accident and claims there are no problems with it. Here they are;",2017,2,21

Lets assume there wasn't any structural damage and it has been repaired to BMW standards and you buy it.

It does look like superficial skin panel type damage, but who knows what might have happened to wiring and electrical components. If you were buying for a 5 year period, accepting it might be worthless at the end, then i could see some potential in buying it, but can't help feel you'd be better buying a 1 series, or Mini or something of that nature to bridge the 2yr period.",2017,2,21

"Let's just look at this rationally 
 
 Not repaired by BMW, so an unknown repair by someone not familiar with the i3/carbon fibre repair techniques 
 In the UK this would be termed a CAT D write off, which normally affects warranty, I would guess you won't be able to make claims easily if at all.  
 
 Insurance is usually more and with the current true value of the vehicle (not what they're selling it for) any insurance company will write it off at it's next accident and pay you a fraction of what you paid 
 
 Impossible to sell on in 2 years time as a private seller and no dealer will touch it 
 You already know parts of the repair have not been done/done well because you can see it....what about the bits you can't see 
 front suspension/steering geometry could well be damaged/out of alignment (very likely) 
 were genuine parts used to repair it (e.g. airbag, seatbelt tensioners etc..). 
 If after reading the above points, you still think it makes a sensible purchase....good luck with it! 
 
I think it's useful you posted this though, because across the internet there are many i3 owners who are under the mistaken impression that their i3 will be worth lots and useful in 7 or 8 years time and they can put bigger batteries in etc.. They even believe the bullsh%^t BMW have put around about how easy the cars are to repair after an accident and people shouldn't be worried about carbon fibre etc.. I remember how much and how difficult structural carbon fibre parts on gliders were to repair! 
 
There is not huge damage on a 2015 car, yet it was enough to write it off!...once i3s are even 4 or 5 years old, I think a relatively minor accident will easily write them off due to repair costs.",2017,2,21
"I see a lot totalled car, fix and sold here in Poland. 
 
Normally are car coming from US or other countries .. and fixed here in Poland since man power is cheaper, and maybe some spare parts can be find on ""alternative"" cheap markets  
 
Related to the i3 ... it is all about how badly has been crashed .. also a car that has a value of over 22k ... the crash may have been substantial for make the insurance to decide that is more convenient to pay the car owner instead an official garage 
 
i3 frame is Carbon Fibre .. actually is a composite mix sort of plastic reinforced with carbon fibre ... something that if damage, to replace cost a fortune .. and if fixed with ""glue"" or other ""artistic"" technique .. does not give much confidence. 
 
Yes, there is a remote possibility that frame did no got impacted .. but if you are not an expert .. it is hard to verify, even if you ask to inspect the car from the bottom 
 
Personally I think that i3 is too expensive for what it is both as new and as old .. anyhow .. best rule for buy a used car ... is to don't rush your decision .. better is to wait and see if something better can pop up in the market. 
 
In 2 years time when tesla model 3 will be in the market, I expect price of used i3 to sink ... at the moment BMW i3 is still relative alone in its nice market, this is why it can keep is crazy high price ... but to me Tesla 3 and BMW i3 are in the same market segment, and Tesla as brand is as cool as BMW, if not even more ""cool""

TurboCord: World’s Smallest, Lightest, UL-Listed, Flexible Plug-In EV Charger 
 
 
Portable, Reliable, On-the-Go Charging: - Quickly charge your EV up to 3x faster than with the standard cord set that came with your car. Dual voltage means you receive two chargers in one (120V & 240V). Enjoy the power of a Level 2 charger that fits in the palm of your hand. TurboCord is rugged and durable so you can reliably charge anywhere, even outdoors. 
 
 
Simple, Pain-Free Installation: Plug TurboCord Dual into a NEMA 6-20 outlet (installation required) for Level 2 charging or use the 120V adaptor in any standard outlet for Level 1 charging. TurboCord doesn’t require mounting and fits in a backpack while charging up to 3x faster.  
 
With TurboCord’s lightweight, durable 20ft cable, it’s at home charging on the road, or in your driveway. Installation costs are much lower than units that need to be hardwired directly into your home’s electrical system and mounted permanently on a wall. All you need is to install a NEMA 6-20 outlet.  
 
Safe & Reliable UL-listed and tested to meet the strict safety standards, including those of our automaker partners. Your computer, refrigerator, television and other household electronics are UL-listed – shouldn’t your charger be too? Plus, TurboCord can be used indoors or outdoors thanks to its industry-leading NEMA 6P rating.  
 
The TurboCord works with all production battery electric vehicles on the market today, including: Nissan Leaf, BMW i series, Chevrolet Bolt EV, Chevrolet Spark, Fiat 500e, Ford Focus Electric, Kia Soul EV, Hyundai Sonata Plug-In, Mercedes B-Class Electric Drive, Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Smart Electric Drive, Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X, Volkswagen e-Golf, Tesla Model 3 and more!

 We bought this cord to replace the original which we thought had problems. The issue actually stemmed from our vehicle. We ended up trading the car and now have an extra (like) new cord.

"I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to :  How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper   
 
Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required?  
 
Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991  https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/  
 
Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?",2020,11,19
"The 500e is going on sale imminently in the UK (the new version). Not sure what colour/location brake lights and indicators the US 500e has, or what fog lights/reflectors it has. The modifications to make it compliant could be costly. I can't recall if the 500e has rapid charging, but if it's CCS Type 1 you will not be able to rapid charge anywhere (we use CCS Type 2). Also while the Type 1 inlet will accept 230v, will it be happy at 50hz rather than 60? I'd hope so but not sure.",2020,11,19

"I was able to buy a new Red edition (I wanted a Red car!) last week but could not have the options I wanted. Has anyone any experience of fitting (for off road use only) LED headlights and if so would they recommend a manufacturer/model? Many thanks, Mark",2022,3,8
"We also have a red 500 Red Edition (SWMBO wanted a red car!)  
 
Do you really think the standard headlights are that bad? We have had the car about 4 months now and, even on the unlit lanes where we live, have no issues driving at night?",2022,3,8
Yep I have a 500e Red er in red . I too have the standard headlights. My other car has LED headlights so I really hate the Fiat's yellow weedy lights. Like two moths in jamjars. I've just bought two Simoni racing H19's 4200k bulbs. Should be a straight replacement. I'll post here if they are any better. I'm loathe to fit an aftermarket led conversion as I value it being road legal. But I must do something they really are that awful.,2022,3,8
Hi there - I was wondering if you had luck with the new bulbs and if it improved the colour of the beam? Cheers,2022,4,23

Ah ok keep us posted - I assumed it’s quite a simple change but maybe not.,2022,4,23
"NEW 500. 
Well that's about time lol. 
Maybe they'll use the current 500 motors in the new Panda (smaller car, if that's possible). and develop new (bigger ones) for the new 500. 
Although there looks to be a Panda and a grande version ( although probably a normal sized Panda with plastic cladding). 
Whatever, looking forward to seeing what Fiat have in store- hoping we'll even get a small Alfa with a pokey motor, now that would be interesting.",2022,1,18
"I'd be very surprised at a 200 mile winter range. That requires efficiency witchcraft of the EQXX variety or at least a 50kWh battery. I can't see this taking the Zoe's small car range crown. It just needs to be less basic and have a more commuter friendly top speed than the Spring, at the right price. My guess is a 40kWh battery, maybe as small as 30kWh. It's whether they option it with something bigger at a sensible price.",2022,1,18
"Pandas are amazing little cars: five of us driving from Torino to an agriturismo up a road which became covered in snow as we climbed. No problem and tremendous fun, and not the 4WD version either. I've just checked the maps: my Italian friend would need a range of 90 winter miles for a regular trip she does so I can't see her getting one, but don't assume people use them purely as city cars in Italy.",2022,1,18
"Sounds brilliant and I love the shape proposed and modular concept. 
 
We had a panda (and a cinquecento sporting) for years and loved them,so much character.",2022,1,19
"I actually kinda like the simplicity of this. I quite like the idea of stripping out all the unnecessary tech that gets jammed into cars nowadays that does nothing but make it expensive, and replacing it with the same phone I use for the other 23 hours a day. 
 
I'll be interested to see the battery size and the boot! 
 
I might even be tempted to give up the remote climate control from my Leaf if this turns out to be a good car, with good range, a battery that will last well, nice fast CCS charging and sensible luggage capacity 🤔 Ultimately I'd be delighted to just have my Leaf but with CCS and a bigger battery, but it doesn't seem like anyone's going to make that for a sensible price anymore.",2022,1,19
"Problem is that the current safety led systems are adding significantly to the price of seemingly all UK delivered cars - airbags everywhere, EBD, ESP, LDW, ACC, Blind Spot/Rear crossing warning etc. The FIAT Panda had little if any of these systems (depending on the age that we are harking back to) and it'll be interesting to see if these are stripped out to get down to a price - they clearly cannot be replaced with a mobile phone App. 
Speaking personally, I'd be happy without them but accept that I'm different to the majority.",2022,1,19
"Probably all about ncap ratings and EU regs. 
Some of which have little or no impact on saving your life-TPMS? 
Yes I want my car to give me some protection but I really don't want stuff that adds significantly to the price that work away away in the background and cost a fortune to fix when they inevitably go wrong out of warranty. 
Simple, basic, a-b motoring is all I want.",2022,1,19
"It's a remarkable piece of how marketing can manipulate people. 
 
All these reminiscences over past Pandas. 
 
Do you folk really think this new Panda EV will share even a single switch with the old Pandas you know? 
 
The only thing they have in common is the name. 
 
It's like going aboard the Russians' 'Atomflot' nuclear powered ice breaker '[50 years of] Victory' and saying 'ah, yes, it's just like I remember seeing Nelson's 'Victory' in Portsmouth'. 
 
.. The power of advertising!   .....",2022,1,19
"Indeed, the Panda has always been designed as a compact, cheap, simple and therefore reliable car for people who just want a car. The joy of simplicity!",2022,1,19
"On the plus side, making all these safety systems compulsory will drive down the cost and increase the reliability - eventually. 
 
But to put it all jn perspective, the top of the range Panda (100hp like ours) was priced at £9995 when it went off sale in 2010. It had climate control, ABS, traction control, and two airbags, which was a fair bit more than the minimum legal requirement. However paired down the EV Panda is, it’s unlikely that the base model will retail for less than twice the cost.",2022,1,19

"I had a Panda 100HP about ten years ago. Loved driving it, but always felt that something expensive could go wrong with the mechanics. And I don't think it got much past six years of life. 
 
Would love to see an electric Panda. Guess they could base it on the same platform as the Corsa and 208 if the 500 platform isn't used. Give it the classic tall back end and stick as little possible past the wheels at each end. 
 
Can't see it going for much under 20k, but would be great to see that barrier broken - shame the Dacia won't be crossing the channel.",2022,5,4

Which card(s) have the best coverage for continental Europe, specially the Benelux, France and Germany? 
Price is secondary to me, but if you can tell me cheaper options, I'm all for it. 
 
So far I own the Enodrive Zen card by Luxembourgish electricity provider Enovos. 
The network of public chargers it covers in the country is impressive, prices seem to be ok (0,345€/kWh at 22kW chargers and 0,485€/kWh at the fast chargers) but it has a few holes abroad, especially when it comes to fast chargers.",2022,8,7

Seems like I'm covered with only one card although I'm inclined to get a NewMotion card as backup, but the site seems to be down at the moment.",2022,8,7
"I've just gave Shell a call. 
In my country Shell Recharge/NewMotion is only available for companies.",2022,8,9

"I messed up a little yesterday. 
Somehow the Shell Recharge site doesn't work with my internet provider. I had to use the internet of my mobile phone and I accidentally let me send two activation links. 
Anyhow I might be better off using another card. The Fiat salesman will recommend me one when I see him on Thursday, I'll check its conditions and the network of charging stations I can use with it.",2022,8,9

"OK, I'm confused but I'm sure someone here can help me, also if this question has been asked and answered ad nauseam - I apologise - but like I said, I'm new here. 
 
1. My understanding was the Ampera battery would charge to a 50 mile capacity, only getting 38 miles range coming up on the dash after 10 hour overnight charge, what am I doing wrong. 
2. I want to run the petrol engine first thing to warm/demist/heat seats etc and thought I could do this using the HOLD mode, problem is the HOLD mode is greyed out, what am I doing wrong. 
3. When you look at the power train screen and the engine is surrounded with the glowing green halo, does this mean the engine is running? 
4. Is there any advantage in getting the most powerful home charge assembly or is the one supplied with the car when plugged into a good 10amp socket just as good? 
 
Thanks",2015,10,14
@ Richard_Gledhill What I meant was the using L you are missing out on any regen that happens when going downhill - especially when using the cruise control. When in L the car's speed increases when in D it is more controlled with the regen. I hope that explains roughly what I was trying to point out.,2015,10,23
"True, but if you gently brake while in D to hold the speed down to the limiter, you will get exactly the same regen as if you were in L. I actually often use L to keep the speed to 30mph in hilly villages, it's very useful.",2015,10,23
I think the confusion here might be that the brake pedal in the Tesla is just that - friction brakes.,2015,10,23
"... so, yesterday we went to look at a Zoe for the wife; clever marketers these French chappies, the old Zoe with the R240 motor (capable of quick charge) is now being marketed as the best thing since sliced bread (£++) and the NEW Zoe with the Q210 motor, which isn't capable of the quick charge but has a tiny notional increase in range is actually CHEAPER, what a swiz.",2015,10,26
"Yes sorry, the dealer confused me, the R40 is the 'old' version and the Q210 the 'new' - right? Glad to have the support and advice of the forum, even the keen dealerships don't seem to have much of a clue. BTW, as an aside, the dealer showed us a cute trick involving closing the door, resetting the trip, closing the door again etc etc anyhow, long story short, he succeeded in 'freeing' the reserve charge and putting it 'in the tank' increasing the shown mileage from 80 to 120. Is this smoke and mirrors, also is there a similar dodge for the AMPERA, I'd just love to get at the 25% reserve, not all of it just another 5 miles or so,",2015,10,26
"Believe me you don't want the reserve - it's there to keep the battery life. You could use the reserve if you wanted to (if Vauxhall allowed it) and then your batteries would lose their capacity after a few years... That's why it's not a reserve, it's a buffer there to protect the battery life. 
That ""cute trick"" is likely to result in a bunch of Zoes with dead batteries in a year or two's time...",2015,10,26
"Ah, thanks ... again.",2015,10,26
"@Russ 
 What are you on? 
R240 is new with reduced maximum charge rate Q210 has the larger charge rate. 
If you charge from a 32A lead you won't notice the difference but should have a better range. 
No idea about the door trick but agree regarding the Ampera as I often run out a mile from home and have to glide in burning oil.  
 
Sleep deprivation !!",2015,10,26
"See my other reply to your thread - as far as I'm aware this isn't releasing any extra range, it's just resetting a computer average - don't believe everything a salesman tells you!!",2015,10,26

"All it does is change the throttle pedal so that effectively all the travel is in the first inch or so of travel and after that it makes no difference. However at higher speeds (> about 40mph) it keeps the main motor engaged rather than switching in the smaller motor, which is slightly less efficient but gives instant response as it then doesn't need to swap back again if you put your foot down again.",2015,10,30
"I also find the 'normal' setting only really allows for around 60kW, unless you slam the pedal, i.e. it is very non-linear at the end of the travel in 'normal' while 'sport' gives you a linear response from 0 (or -50kW if in regen!) to 111kW.

Bugatti lost as much money as they received from the buyer on every Veyron, but again it's a halo effect on the brand and the brand's group (also VW group).

"They just need to use the drivetrain in other vehicles. Part of the reason the Ampera didn't sell was down to the practicalities, the four seats, the somewhat 'scattergun' approach to the design of the centre console. Don't get me wrong, my last car 'only' had four seats and you get used to the touch sensitive buttons (though they never get easy). But the drivetrain could be used in other cars, after all the engines used in an Astra aren't unique to that model, they could even license it to other manufacturers (eg I think the Agila was a shared platform with Suzuki and used some Suzuki engines). They technology would then start to become more familiar to the buying public.

"Forgive me for revisiting the ""D vs L"" topic, but I'm not sure that everything was made clear. And as has been pointed out before, I seem to enjoy being wordy... 
 
The *only* difference between ""D"" and ""L"" is the mapping for the acceleration and regen. That's it. Whether in ""D"" or ""L"" it doesn't matter one bit with regards to efficiency other than how the driver drives it. Now, with that said... 
 
The most-efficient mode of travelling is *coasting* and not using regenerative braking (or any braking). When you're trying to hypermile and eek out the most mileage out of the battery that you possibly can then you are actively looking for opportunities to travel while avoiding any braking at all. So, when you're approaching a stop or slower traffic you will want to coast for as long as possible before braking. If you can coast and reach the stop with only ever needing to press the brake from, say, 5-10 mph, then you did very well. Of course, doing so will annoy the drivers behind you, so that level of aggressive hypermiling is really not appropriate in traffic, but even when in traffic you can employ the same principles as much as is appropriate. 
 
Now, the issue I mean to clarify is this: it is *much* easier to coast in ""D"" than in ""L"". For the most part if you let go of the pedals in ""D"" then you are coasting. (Yes, there is some regen there, but it's very insignificant.) It's much more-difficult to find that coasting spot when in ""L"". 
 
However, ""L"" does make driving in stop-and-go traffic much easier *and* ""L"" is extremely useful on long downhill stretches when you may not want your brake lights to be constantly lit up (as the driver behind you will not know when you're slowing or not if your brake lights are permanently on). 
 
So, when I drive I am almost always in ""D"", and when I can coast I do so. However, when I'm in slow, heavy traffic or when I am on a long, downhill stretch I will use ""L"". And that's really what most others here are saying - so... that was a lot of words to say nothing additional, probably.",2015,11,12
Well clarified Lee! And thank you for putting in the bit about being considerate to other drivers too. And also thank you for not proposing the dangerous and completely pointless approach of going into N to coast.,2015,11,12
"Just on the subject of coasting down slowly..... 
 
... There are circumstances where I would naturally agree with you, e.g. approaching a give way/stop junction. But approaching lights that have just turned red, or approaching a stationary queue of traffic, no, I am not going to 'drive up' to the lights and brake at the last minute, I am going to let the car coast naturally. Many is the time I have come up in an empty lane of a multiple lane junction with some truck, white van or BMW bearing down on me because I haven't been exceeding the speed limit until the last 5 yards before the stop, and then, ah, fancy that, the lights change just as I get there! They do do this after a while! Who'd have thought it! So I go sailing through with carry-on speed, leaving the other lanes for dead, and the lunatics behind have actually been advantaged by my driving, not disadvantaged. 
 
Yes, many is the time people have pulled out and overtaken me as I slow down gradually for red lights.... only for me to sail past them again because, of course, they have had to brake and stop..... 
 
I will drive in a way that is of maximum benefit to all,  even if their puny brains cannot comprehend what I am doing!!!!",2015,11,12

"No-one, anywhere, has yet reported battery degradation in a Volt/Ampera, and there are a lot of them about world-wide.

The packs were very accurately matched for cell balance and high manufacturing tolerances, are arranged in triple cells, and have a very active thermal management. 
 
Of course, outright faults can occur with any device, and there have been incidents of battery problems. But nothing credible seen in regards Volt/Ampera battery degradation yet. 
 
In winter it becomes very heavily dependent on how you use the car. I did several short town journeys the other week and was headed towards less than 25 miles on one battery charge! Didn't matter as that was enough, but I am still expecting to be back up to mid-50's in summer. 
 
Reality is that electric charge displaces fuel, at a pretty given rate. [Generalisation warning!...] Each full battery charge saves you 4 litres of fuel. It doesn't sound like a huge amount, but it sure adds up, especially if you are doing an extra charge during the day!

It is an estimate, there are no absolutes of battery charge measurement for any Li-ion. Only your real range is important and objective, and in winter, for any EV, that can be a half of your summer range if you 'use' the car and make good use of the heater. 
 
If you have an energy monitor attached to the line to the charge point, this can also provide a measure of 'consistency', which is probably more reliable than the on board battery diagnostics. My full battery charge (from the 'wall') varies from ~11.5kWh to ~12.2kWh real energy consumed. Typically it is consistently around 11.5kWh if I have run the car down to reading '0km' or '1km' on the range estimate, or variable if it has gone to petrol (the buffer can then vary significantly).

"I hear you  @Sandy  But in essence the answer seems to be ""yes"" then. 
 
Forgive me for being a sceptic. VW is going to kill all other brands with electric and they have already sourced 50 years of their entire car production of batteries. Yap, yap, yap, yap.

"I still maintain that PSA are doing what they have to with electrification for EU emissions - they aren't in it the same way as the Renault Nissan alliance. 
 
Faced with much higher costs to get into an e208 or ID, I can see many Zoe owners sticking with Renault and the new Zoe. It will be a major update to the existing, especially the interior and I suspect will be launched in September in Frankfurt for delivery early 2020.  
 
It will be interesting to see what Renault do with battery rental. Even if they keep the option I can see more Zoe being sold as a one car solution, so battery owned will probably be more popular. Dealers advise that to date most Zoe were 2nd cars. Clearly those have lower annual mileage, so rental was cost effective.",2019,4,25
"I think we do need more of the affordable EVs, rather than fewer, to get more people on board (or even to prevent me having to revert to ICE in 6 and a bit years when the Zoe runs out of extended warranty and everything second hand that isn't a gen 1 Leaf with half dead battery is upwards of £10k). The notion that Zoes will lose their affordability is troubling... 
 
I realise this is an enthusiast forum and most probably have deeper pockets here than I have, but surely many, many of the general public are in the same position as me in that their budget is a 3-6 year old car for £4-6k every now and then (stretched to 7 in this case), for other people even less, and they're not going to want to pay huge prices or have to wait until one is 10 years old and could have a 4 figure repair bill at any moment

"I think you are under-estimating the economic concept of learning curve for industrial goods (price reduces x% with each doubling of number of items produced). And well, production is massively increasing all over the board and that most definitely includes Renault. Phones, Wind turbines, Solar panels, BEVs. As opposed to resource based goods. 
 
The only things that I see making a ZOE more expensive in the long run are:- 
 
 ""because they can"", as in, price elasticity places the overall optimum (for Renault) at a different price point. I highly doubt this and I have not seen any indication of such a strategy shift; 
 ZOE growing in capabilities faster than said learning curve effect. This of course is a natural tendency all car makers have, upping models and introducing new models at the bottom.

I'm no expert on economics and just look at smartphones since the iPhone era started (i.e. the rectangular capacitive screen type). They've steadily increased, rather than decreasing, in price - particularly in the past 5 years or so when they've skyrocketed. Why...

I buy decent (mid spec) Android phones, for just over 100 euro's. I regard a ZOE as a ""lower mid spec"" type of car.

This would surely be the best way to keep the cost down while still satisfying most people who would consider a Zoe, wouldn't it? If you drive very long distances frequently then you're not likely to be looking at a Zoe anyway, so why spec the battery for those people?",2019,4,26

"Let's get something out of the way: I do agree! 
 
However, I think we need to be super careful with this type of reasoning, because we have a serious apples/oranges risk here. 
 
1a) we know for a fact that our late model Q90 ZOE's have a 43 kW spec'd and capable charger, and by inference a battery capable of (close to) 43 kW DC intake. 
1b) We also know that this power intake is only achieved under optimal conditions, even while it has advanced temperature control. 
 
2a) we know that the ""how great it's going to be"" cars have +60 kW spec'd charging capability. I am ignoring the fact that most current CCS chargers have 50 kW capacity, because it will go up. There are 4 200 kW chargers 1.5 miles from my house. However, suddenly....... 
2b) some assume that the latter ones will automagically have none of said or other type of throttling, while at the same time knowing nearly nothing about their control system. Given that it's not Renault but actually LG that build ZOE's battery control system, I honestly think this is, in a sort of British understatement, a ""quite optimistic"" assumption. 
 
I would be careful placing your bets on the laughing stock. My own speculation is that the CCS charging ZOE will charge moderately faster, and that a lot of newcomers will disappoint in real life performance compared to paper specs. I know I have been quite the a** using the ""how great it's going to be when you get it"" (it's from an old joke about Microsoft BTW), but let's not be gullible and pretend that paper cars are real cars, or that paper cars are never spec'd in a way to simply let customers wait for ""that fantastic thing just around the corner"". 
 
The only other way to make the narrative fit in a consistent way is to assume that the current ZE40 battery system is an extremely compromised or outdated design. I have trouble wrapping my head around that assumption.",2019,4,26
"It's easy to look at the Tesla rapid charging rates and say why can't other cars match them. Well there are two limiting factors, if you have a battery half the size it can only take half the charging current. Tesla has liquid cooling with every cell in direct contact with the cooling pipe. The cells are small cylindrical cells that can transfer their heat rapidly. 
 
The Zoe uses larger prismatic cells and forced air cooling. Forced air cooling is never going to be as even and efficient as liquid cooling and the larger prismatic cells won't be able to transfer their internal heat to the air as efficiently as the cylindrical cells. This means that the charging rate will need to be further limited, it makes little sense to allow 100kW charging if you then have to really throttle it back to stop the cells getting too hot. 
 
Hopefully the 2020 Zoe will get a bit faster charging, but don't expect too much.",2019,4,27
It was the comparison with the Ioniq and the smaller battery variants of the Kona and Niro I was thinking of rather than the many artists impressions for things a couple of years out.

"I love that the battery lease is still popular. It nicely brings an EV that is practical enough for use as a main and only car (at least for relatively adventurous people who don't mind the odd wait for a public charge and aren't zipping 400 miles up and down the country day in day out) within the reach of ordinary people on ordinary (or below) salaries. Second hand, anyway. Far as I see it, there are vast swathes of us who normally spend like ""up to £7k"" (dependent on how much we want to push the boat out) on a 5 year old something-or-other and aim to keep it for at least 5 years, so never dreamed we'd be able to own an EV for a decade or more. Battery lease brings the Zoe (and only 3 year old at that) into that market.  
 
Of course, it's the first owner who decides whether to buy or lease the battery and creates the initial demand so I can't speak for  why  it's still popular, but I imagine it's just a similar story slightly further up the societal food chain. And if you keep it for a shorter time than (value of battery / monthly payments) months, then it works great as an affordable way to dip your toes in. 
 
As for whether lease costs would drop, maybe the mileage would become more generous? (We can dream...) but I doubt the baseline £49 would change, as there's still £6k worth of battery that needs paying for which would take 10 years at that rate.",2019,5,16
"The irrational side of me says I should own the battery, but the sums just don't add up. For 9000 miles per year my hire rate is effectively £57 per month or £684 pa. If I keep the £5000 saved on not buying a battery in the stock market and get a return of 4.5% it would take me just under 10 years to have paid less to own the battery. I'm guessing that a 10 year old 22kWh Zoe will be virtually valueless with either an owned or hired battery as it will no longer be covered by extended warranty so it wouldn't make any difference for me to have owned or hired the battery (I will probably buy a new car before then but we might get a bigger long distance car we might keep the Zoe for commuting and for our children to learn to drive in). Renting the battery I get a better warranty and bundled road side recovery. 
 
It's been argued before that having a rented battery on an old car might increase it's value as it then has a battery warranty. I suspect the owned versions will sell for more though.",2019,5,16
"For lower mileage users the PCP with battery lease is cheaper I think. If you are a higher mileage user and need the 7500 mile lease and above I think the battery owned car is then the same monthly cost. Unlimited mileage is more expensive still. So owned is cheaper. 
 
Renault site isn't showing battery owned as even an option. Mandatory battery hire link is giving me a 404 file not found error just at the moment too.",2019,5,16
"It is starting to get tested as warranties expire and people find it costs more to repair those PEC or motor failures than they're worth. Extend that warranty, people! 
 
We're seeing more HEVRA places pop up though, and I think we'll see more third party warranty / electromechanical breakdown insurance kind of products popping up as well when the problem becomes more prevalent.

"So the current (battery owned) Zoe starts from £27,820 before PICG which is quite a bit less than the eCorsa at £29,990 for entry model, but that does have more features. 
 
I suspect we will see the new Zoe increase price slightly but be below £29K. The big questions are (a) will the large discounts and finance contributions continue and (b) will they offer battery rental to make it more affordable (at low mileage) over 3/4 years?",2019,6,5

When you google ""UK EV conversion"" you come up with some quite old links, some dead links, parts suppliers and peoples personal projects (some of which are very old) 
 
Inspired as I am by @Henryvv awesome 911 conversion I would be looking at something more thrifty but still fun rather than practical. Ideally I would like to buy a running car for under 5k and then spend 5-10K converting it to an EV - does this sound like a practical budget? 
 
I would need to the conversion to be done for me, to a reasonably professional and safe standard as I am not electrically competent and I am am not going to drive my family around in something dangerous! The car will need to be all-weather and not too fragile. 
 
I am also interested in which vehicles people think would make a suitable candidate for a fun runabout, my current thoughts are : 
 
 Mazda MX-5 
 Honda S2000 
 BMW Z4 convertible 
 But I have also toyed with : 
 
 Toyota MR2 
 MGF

"Its all about your expectations. New parts alone will cost more than your budget. 
I had one guy who was adamt that his £4k budget would get him a conversion (done for him) that could do 100 miles / charge and with fast 0 to 70 speed. Just unrealistic. You have to convert because you want the car. Not because its a cheap way of getting an EV, it isnt. 
Most of the cars you list are possible, but with all such cars the placement of the battery pack is the challenge if you wish to retain full boot space. A compromise.  
Fixed gear is perfectly good for many applications, and simplifies any conversion as you dont need to build a new flywheel. But you could use the gearbox, say in 1st or second for faster acceleration, and then just leave it in 2nd or 3rd for simple driving. 
Used parts are a good option, especially used Leaf packs.  
A lot of the parts I hold in stock such as HPEVS AC50 motors and Curtis controllers are new but old stock, but also substantially cheaper than newly importing from the USA. To make these function I hold cabling contactors throttle pots , and make the motor couplings / adaptor plates to suite each application. 
My own preference would be the MX5 or MGF, the latter has a lot going for it, especially as you can get a lot of aftermarket bits including spring replacements / adjustable spring mounts. Later models are also cheap, and ones with dodgy K series engines/ cylinder head problems do come up a lot. Im just under 6ft tall and find it increasingly difficult to get in and out of these cars. Something to consider for longer term ownership.",2017,2,4
A Bedford Rascal/Diahatsu mini van EV would be most fun. You'd think the running gear and gubbins from an old knackered imiev would be the ideal candidate?,2017,2,4
"I just love my Smart Conversion, not the fastest in the world, but so much fun. I have another one thats waiting for me to rebuild it (silver 2008) having been a prototype conversion by another company. With the battery pack under the floor, its just so stable. I also have used motors and curtis controller to suit and adaptor plates for the 451 already made. The battery pack could readily be built with Leaf cells. But the great thing is nothing intrudes into the usable space inside. 
The only issue I have with the Smart is the gear ratios. Mine is in third and is a touch sedantary, it will do 70mph down hill with the wind behind but 2nd would give a more spirited performance, but would not get much above about 55. I inadvertantly got it into reverse when I last rebuilt it, with the motor running in the correct direction it would burn rubber up to about 15mph, but run out of puf quickly.  
Might be worth looking at how one could control the motorised gear change, but in mine I had to remove that to get the charger and BMS under the rear floor.",2017,2,4
"Are RX-8s not generally dirt cheap to buy as they are so expensive to run and regularly have engine failure? The less you spend on the initial car the more you have left over for the EV conversion. Or as mentioned above, an MGF that has had a Head Gasket Failure and is being scrapped for £100 ...",2017,2,4
"Its rarely the case a car with ""just"" a head gasket failure would be scrapped.... its normally got a catalogue of other faults or things needing doing and also usually has an affinity with tin work before they get scrapped for £100.

If you have a cherished car that you want to live on as an EV, great, spend the money, the fact it's almost worthless afterward doesn't matter because to you the car is priceless. If you want to do a quality job on a decent car (don't forget, spending £5k on an MX5 and then £10k giving it performance and range not quite as good as a £10k second hand Leaf, you are still driving a £5k MX5 which, with a quick scan of autotrader, is going to get you an 8-10 year old car with a not so nice interior ) then your budget needs to be higher, and you'll quickly get to Tesla Roadster money.",2017,2,4
"I instantly thought MX-5 but then I saw the S2000 on the list. Try one before buying as they're pretty tight inside but that would be a great one since the engine along will fetch quite a bit back thanks to every man and his dog wanting it for their civic. Motor where the diff was, replace engine, gearbox and fuel tank space with batteries and it would be a laugh.",2017,2,4
"Actually a lot of MGFs are scrapped because of engine failures. Head gaskets arnt a simple job on the K series, as they have through bolts down to the bottom of the engine  base.These bolts have to be changed and often arnt. Many garages just replace the head gasket which soon goes again requiring skimming of the head or worse still the block. Owners are regularly getting £500 bills for K series head gasket failures. Hence why people often walk away from them at that point. 
MX5 is a readily available and economic option, The Honda s2000 is always an expensive beast and always fetches higher prices. Even with a bu88ered engine. Its also a bit heavier, and body panels are not cheap. 
I think I would go for the MG or the MX5, probably edging towards the MG as parts are readily available for brakes suspension etc, and body panels are plentiful should you need them. 
With a bit of careful planning you should be able to buy and convert something of the size you are looking for, for the £15k budget. But you may need to do some of the work or running around yourself to keep the cost down. For instance could you extract the original drive train your self ? Strip out the fuel system gear linkage etc.  
I have had an owner come over and work with me on his vehicle, not just to keep costs down but to understand a bit more of whats going on.",2017,2,5

For the £15K I am guessing you might squeak to 50 miles range, 0-60 in the 10 second range and probably quite a struggle to 70, with 3kW charging only to keep budget for batteries? Open-top cars are draggy old things ...",2017,2,5
"I have to confess to having a steadily growing desire to look into converting a Mercedes SL (2004-2008) to electric. I even got as far as looking through eBay listings a week or two ago for donor cars.

"Am looking at a very early 1960 Merc 220 coupe for a customers conversion. Its a bit heavy but has the world largest boot for battery storage.  
Personally im collecting parts for a fiat 500 conversion (1970s not current) and in the past have looked at a Daihatsu Copen, they would make a really great car, small, open top, reasonably new suspension technology, and fun. But small and I fear even harder to get into than an MGF.  
I will stick with the fiat 500 for the moment, as having a third member of the family (not yer a teenager) we cant all get into the smart and I cant justify more two seaters in the personal fleet.  
I also still have the makings of a 1926 Model t two sedan that was originally going to have supra suspension, supra 6 speed box and Fiat/alfa 2.4 diesel. All the bits sitting unloved in my shed. Now that would be fun as an EV, but its just too much work at the moment. Why a 26t? well I used to make 26t roadster bodies in the 1980s( I still have the body moulds) and always wanted one, but again the issue of a third member of the family made that no longer an option. Hence about 6 years ago the start of the tudor parts collection.",2017,2,6
"Isn't it odd how sleeping on something produces ideas! 
I woke this morning thinking a Reliant Scimitar sports car might make a suitable conversion, rare and so stylish.",2017,2,6
"And expensive if you have one thats any good, and even more expensive if you have one with rusted chassis worn suspension and badly crazed body panels. 
Not sure about weight, they were not particularly light vehicles, and access to the running gear and chassis for repairs isnt the nicest. Chassis rot is so common, and really hard to repair properly. Thats why its not generally rapaired properly. 
A freind had one a few years ago, he spend a lot of money and time on repairing the suspension bushes/ chassis, ending up replacing a lot more than he intended. He eventually got rid of it after having it about 5 years and spending more on parts than the car cost him in the first place, and no end in  sight.They are a bit like an EV conversion, you have to really want them and not worry about the cost too much. 
 
Having got it mechanically good, the crazed body was just a step too far. (the paint having sunk and crazed from less than adequate original gell coat thickness and too much filler and celulose paint) The quotes from paint shops were just so high. The labour involved with mechanically stripping the car (not good to use stripper on crazed GRP) repairing the cracks in the gelcoat, and refinishing were expected to be huge. On GRP, a small star crack has to be cut back to the mat, new mat put in ground back and new gel/ surface applied then blended in. You can sand and fill a star but it will always come back. 
My most challenging GRP repair was on a 1986 Lotus Excel that had an engine / frontal burn, so I cut in new front and partial wing as well as making the double skin inner arch from scratch. What made it worse was the car was black, so straight lines (lots on that car) were even more obvious. But the previously enjoyed bonnet just kept giving up its cracks many of which you couldnt see as it arrived stripped ready for primer.",2017,2,6
"Yes,this is all very nice if you are poked with money and just want a nice ""toy"" to show off in,but how about ""the well heeled"" spending money in a more altruistic manor,educate people to do EV conversions safely,put in place support and convert emergency and community vehicles,giving people jobs and support for those less well off.

This early conversion culture could be the seed of a huge industry converting the ice fleet. We need well heeled people to take large risk in order to train and evolve the sector so I may be able to scrape together much less in the future to get a bullet proof ev conversion.,2017,2,6
"There really is no commercial value in converting the existing ICE fleet. Used car prices here in the UK are now so low that many vehicles are being scrapped due to repair costs. The worst killer being people who take their sub 10 year old Diesel to have a clutch changed and find the cost will be well over £1k as it has a Dual Mass flywheel, yes there are alternatives but many garages especially main dealers wont offer you that. Hence they get scrapped. 
Even used EVs are now becoming very cheap with early leafs now heading towards £6k . You can get a Kangoo for around £3k , but you would be very lucky to get a dealer to take it off you at any price. 
So the costs of conversion for general vehicles just does not stack up. Hence its really only an option to do a vehicle you really want to have / classic etc. Even doing it your self with used parts why spend £5 to 10 k on a £500 fiesta,. Makes no sense.",2017,2,6

I wonder whether it would be possible to add a leaf battery pack into that space and a leaf motor under the bonnet. Afaik they do not really suffer from rust/paint issues, suspension parts do wear but you might want to upgrade all those anyway with the extra weight? It would then be a more car like alternative to an env200. If you could convert for 10k you could easily get an 8 year old donor car for a few hundred so a can similar to an env200 for similar money to the cheapest passenger env200 or be it the donor car would be 5 years older.

"Panda, send Drayton an email so they have a record of your interest and details. You might find someone drops out or another car pops up. There are currently 38 used B250e's on the Mercedes web site. When I visited two dealers to check out the car it was clear they'd seen little interest in them and we're keen to make space. Mention the Lincoln and Drayton deals and see what happens. The 36 month Mercedes finance deals value the B250e at £12500 at the end of term. If they keep the same residual value on the used £15000 car over a 24 month contract, then the £2,500 difference could result in very low monthly payments.

"Hello Everyone  
I'm new here. I live in East London.  
I've been looking at EVs for a while. I had the Leaf for three days, the i3 for 24 hours. Renault never bothered to even call me back. I've been eyeing the B250e for a while but inly recently when it was tested on fullychargerd I managed really find out more about it.  
Reading your posts here makes me really think that would be sufficient for my wife for every day use as well as our occasional trips within and around London.  
The other problem I had was that our off street parking on our estate is about 20 metres away from our house but managed to find a post here stating that someone had a 25 metre lead made by one of the providers.  
I'd have two questions.  
1.) We are looking at moving houses in the near future. Is it worth for me to have a charger wallbox imstalled and a 25m cable made or I could just charge for the time being on a 13Amp socket? Our house is only 8 years old. Wiring should not be a problem I suppose.  
2.) Could any of you help me to find those great deals on the MB B250e as stated in previous posts please? 
 
Thank you

"I think that you will really struggle with this. One issue for all EV cars is the general need to be able to charge at home for most people and this can be a drawback. I think the only chance will be if somehow you have a communal area where a community charger could be put in. But then, you won't have the convenience of parking at home. 
 
The car is really great and I can send you some info where you may get a lease deal if you wish. Are you buying outright or leasing? We have seen 'used' ones for sale for between £15-£20K, with a few hundred miles on the clock. 
 
The MB was never at the top of our list due to lack of rapid charging. But when we realised that we will always have another car for longer journeys, coupled with a desire to have an electric car for the many short journeys we do as a family, it is perfect for us.

As to whether MB will make any more, I am not sure. I think that they need an electric car for the US market, particularly California. A bit like Fiat with the 500e, they don't want to sell any, but they have to offer one. USA Sales are very low as well. 
 
The other point to consider is the JV with BYD in China, they have launched a Denza electric car with a 62kWh and a reported range of 250 miles. If this is any good, maybe they will sell them in Europe?  DENZA Official Website

"Normally I avoid such things like the plague, but I was suckered into MB's monthly maintenance plan. From what I can make out it does seem to work out cheaper than the minimum total servicing costs over the 24 month contract, ans since we'll have the car for that term, and we have to keep the car maintained under the terms of the hire, it seemed like the sensible thing to do. 
 
Can anyone corroborate that? Works out about £18/month or around £400 over the two years, so about £200 cheaper than regular servicing costs (A-service plus B-service).",2016,12,3
"So far it's great, going to put it on the commute test this week. 
 
I received a call offering the service plan with 20% off which meant it was £444 over 24 months. If that works out cheaper than paying as you go I'll go for it tomorrow.",2016,12,4
"Sorry, it worked out at £18.40 a month for 24 months which is just over £440 and the second service alone I believe is £462.99 (not quite sure what for!) so definitely worth while. It was a call I got from Mercedes directly so I'm assuming they will call all new owners??",2016,12,5
"They certainly cold called me and the price was the same. 
 
If the numbers are correct, then its value hinges around the faintly silly cost of the second service. I say silly because I was charged £90 for the last interim Fluence dealer visit, most of that cost being a replacement cabin filter - one of the car's few genuinely consumable items. 
 
I'm going to check up on this and report back. I'm half suspicious this might be the price for the ICE variant rather than for the EV, but having previously had a string of German cars - which in hindsight were far more trouble and far more financial drain than they were really worth - it's possible this is just what it costs to support a lifestyle brand. I'd merely forgotten.

"I would go the independent route in a flash but many of the leasing companies stipulate that you must use an MB dealer. Or if you own the vehilce there is a possible warranty / residual value concern of not having your vehicle showing as serviced on the MB electronic national service database. 
 
I have the B 250 e service schedule here (a friend of a friend works for an MB dealer) and the only thing done at Service A is to change 2 x Desiccant Cartridges and do the usual visual checks of tryes, brake pads, top up washer fluid etc. 
 
The fact that MB service outlets say that the B 250 e is the same cost to service as a petrol or diesel is frankly an insult to my intelligence! 
 
One thing is for sure, I will not be buying a service plan! My B 250 e is on a 2 year lease and what I am most liklely to do is get the A Service done (and I will be haggling hard, I am not paying the same rate as an ICE) at 12 months and 30 days so still within the MB guidlines / tolerance. Therefore when the vehicle is handed back at month 24 Service B is not actually due for another month. 
 
That's the intention at this stage, anyway........",2016,12,6
".....and on a lightly seperate note. A relative of mine with a newish E Class Coupe (ICE) took out his ""MB service plan"" on the very morning that his car was serviced. Now whether the service advisor made a mistake I will never know but esseintally his first service has cost him c. £20 (and he has been paying c. £20 per month ever since) - I guess the service agent earnt their commission for MB for signing someone up and nobody has ever followed up.

The PDF version online is over 300 pages long and it seems a bit naff for Mercedes to have simply omitted a physical version you can e.g. take to bed and read. 
 
The version that is accessible via muddling through screen menus - bit of a chicken and egg situation here - is crap. The PDF is also crap in that various options and features are simply not described anywhere (e.g. Apple CarPlay, neither Apple nor CarPlay appearing in the index, keywords or via document search)

"I'll stick with the PDF then. From what I can make out elsewhere, the CarPlay information is provided in a separate document (which presumably entails a separate PDF). 
 
How did you get on registering for their app? To begin with, I found there to be very little information on the entire concept, and most of the links I followed ended up at the MBUSA site - which of course knew nothing of my car. 
 
I did eventually manage to register by Googling, determining that what I was looking for was called (barf)  Mercedes Me , and having registered subsequently ended up speaking to a German chap last night about getting the car activated. I'd initially spoken with an MB Customer Service rep in Ireland who was working on the assumption that the B has a service contact button, like the Volvo On Call button in the V60, but it doesn't.

I bought a second hand Leaf from a FIAT dealer 2 weeks ago. I've had problems since and the car is currently expected to be at Nissan for 5 weeks awaiting a PTC heater.

I wouldn't expect them to have an EV in the fleet. Considering they've had my car longer than I have and they have the car in with Nissan, I thought maybe they could speak to Nissan about getting a car off them whilst mine is in, with Fiat covering the cost for the inconvenience. 
 
Regarding my driving style, I am driving exactly the same as I do / did in my Leaf where I was achieving over 4mpkwh (albeit with a broken heater). I set off in the garage down a fairly flat road at 65mph and 10 miles later coming off there the economy was 33mpg. Driving locally (hills and short trips due to work) has reduced this further. It's an NA Petrol (not one of these new turbo petrol engines) so really struggles with performance.  
 
Ordinary 500 is no good with a wife, 3 year old and 4 week old unfortunately.

The dealer has been going back and forth with Nissan Technical and Nissan Europe and having to send them all kinds of geometry measurements from hub to hub and wheel arch height etc. I don't have a clue what is going on, a rear axle problem was hinted at but nobody can tell me when I will be getting my car back.

Just a quick (off topic) word on wheel alignment. The last time we changed the rear tyres on our Audi A3 the garage said the wear was very uneven. Sure enough it was when we looked and they checked the alignment which was way out. The owner of the tyre dealer who is time served and a bit of a tyre anorak said that it was the numerous speed bumps that knocked it out and everyone should ideally have theirs checked every 3 months but more realistically 6 months. We have been using this guy for years and he has given us a cheap price to have it done every 6 months when we bring the car in to have the tyres swopped front/rear and diagonally (free) which has to be done as it is a Quattro.,2016,2,5

"As  @Dennis  points out the first limiting factor will be the battery. Current Li-Ion technology is pretty good but does suffer time related degradation and is affected by usage profiles so better managed batteries (eg: active cooled) are likely to be longer lasting. 
 
After that you have normal things like suspension bushes, dampers etc, and finally wheel, motor bearings etc but in theory these latter should be way cheaper than an ICE and probably last a lot longer. Even the bearings on driven wheels will benefit from a much smoother torque delivery with far less ripple. 
 
Add in the fact that you don't have complex mechanical gearboxes, emission control systems and less vibration and I would suspect EVs will last much better. That's another issue for the industry of course because they have to adapt to lower service revenues and probably less product turnover.",2017,9,23

Not many people keep any car for 13 years, unless it is a classic.

"Short range EVs will be useless far earlier than anything with a decent sized battery. Most ICEs still do what they did originally at an advanced age. EVs don't. Fewer parts and higher spares prices will shorten that life even further. 
 
Once you're out of warranty you are on borrowed time with an EV. Many have expensive to fix weaknesses that will write the car off for a lot of people. If there are known expensive failures then second hand prices fall even further so it makes those write offs all the more likely.  
 
Once there is a critical mass then I'm sure indies will start repairing cars more cheaply. Until that happens I think EV lifespan will be rather short for some models. It will get better though. Current cars aren't really good enough for mass uptake. Once they are and they are bought in their droves after a few years I'd imagine longevity will increase.",2017,9,24

"In theory with the possibility of battery replacement and even upgrade it might appear to make sense for example to upgrade a 5 year old 24 to a 40, problem is this would probably cost at least 15k (5k for car, 10k for battery) or only about 5k less than the real price of a new 40kwh and no doubt the upgraded car would be worth a lot less than 15k.",2017,9,24
"The same failings will send an ev to the scrap man as will an ice vehicle. That will probably be electronic modules that are expensive to replace.

Head gaskets don’t just fail anymore, cam chains are reliable, cam belts are reliable... yes a modern diesel has egr and dpf issues, but any petrol built in the last 20 Year’s will go to 200k miles with oil changes at regular intervals.

It seems they have had a number of people take a crack at it with different fields In their database beingvused for numerous purposes which has lead to a lot of confusion, errors abs issues which should never have been seen. 
A lot of work they did was scrapped and they went back to a newer version which had removed loads of features around trips. Seemingly it was implemented without getting the basics right as there were a number of flaws. 
If the read their own documentation about their own API and redid that (as third party developers appear to believe is on the cards) during the process actually set in stone which fields are used for which data and keep to that then they could write a new app ysing all the existing functions that can be done plus adding functions that many other manufacturers have. 
Better charging control. 
Remote control of climate that works properly. 
Remote unlock and lock 
Remote setting of alarm 
Remote horn 
12v state of charge display and conditioning. 
User configurable settings for cutoff points where things should stop working to protect the battery. 
Geolocation that works correctly. 
Allow the user to select what they wish to see for charging data so % kW or miles should all be displayed but a choice of which figure is most prominent. 
The ability to pop up and alert when a certain SoC is reached so people can start making the way back to the CP knowing more accurately what to expect. 
 
It would also be really useful to be able to configure settings for the car which currently have to be done through the infotainment centre. 
 
I'd like to see the ability to access all of this on a separate tablet without affecting the app on the phone but that plus tge other functionality for the app would need properly implemented security so that a third party could not compromise the vehicle.

I can't buy into EV ownership anymore, it's just disguising the monumental problems we are facing with the ever growing urgency of man made global warming and is no more than a sticking plaster when realistically we should all be doing far, far more than we are now. 
 
Going forward, I'll be relying on active travel for local journeys, a combination of public transport and access to a car sharing club when there is no alternative, but the thought of having a 2 ton vehicle sat costing me money outside home/work and more importantly costing the planet isn't something I'm willing to buy into anymore.

"@Swagman  The only way out is to buy more EVs to replace all ICE vehicles. Yes, it might sound crazy, but if you look at the March sales data for cars and vans, diesel has a whopping 92.5% market share for vans, and petrol has a 42% market share for cars. If ex-owners of EVs do not continue to buy and champion EVs, the automakers will default to producing more ICE cars since we need jobs and economy and all that stuff.

"Well at least you (swagman) are not doing a Jeremy Clarkson and running back to ICE. In the future better and greener public transport is the ideal, but we have a long way to go until we have governments that understand and work globally on the pressing issues of our time to create that kind of scenario. 
 
Sadly for most people (people that have kids, or disability issues, or live in very rural area's, or a need for a vehicle they can access when they need it) a personal vehicle is just part of everyday life. It used to be a horse and cart remember. They are just useful items to own for most people, so in that context EV's are actually vital for the transition away from petrochemical societal reliance, and sure at the front end you pay a carbon/industrial cost, but the longtail and back end is what is most important in relation to AGW and the general essential green economies the world must transition to asap. 
 
Personally i would maybe not have gone for a luxury EV (the same kind of issues owning any luxury car includes) but vehicles like the MG-5 and more entry level EV's are offering great bang-for-the-buck and are super cheap to run, which is more in-line with the kind of greening we need in personal car ownership thinking (i have an e-NV200 myself, practical size for family etc). 
 
By (us the public) buying and using EV's we are sending a clear message to the car manufacturers (and the petroleum industries connected with them) and governments about the next steps in the correct way forward. That messaging is important (look at Volkswagen etc). 
 
Maybe the day we simply don't need personal transport (work/educate at home, order in drone drop deliveries etc) will be a good day? But until then an EV is the next important mass uptake we need to see supported by people and governments, we have to start to stop the strangle hold on our world that the fossil-fuel industry currently has, or there simply will not be a world to govern in the next few hundred years, we are that close to snuffing out (as per the link), and EV's are just 'part' of that mitigation plan:

"There used to be a bus from Newport to Telford (in Shropshire) once an hour and it passed through our village in Lilleshall. But because it was once an hour you would have to plan going shopping a bit, and if you finished shipping and the next bus was 50 minutes, you just had to wait in the shopping centre.  
 
They then changed it to every half an hour which seemed at first to be a commercially poor decision since the buses were not running close to full every hour. 
 
But curiously enough the buses running every half an hour were just as full or even a bit more so than the hourly service. The decision to increase the frequency increased the total number of passengers by double or more. 
 
Every half an hour removes the need to plan and even made it just about plausible to use the service without even looking at the timetable, which probably made more people use it.  
 
That made it into quite a bit more of a useful service. 
 
I suppose they also got some passengers from people who would have looked at their watch and thought ""oh, just missed the bus, I'll drive"" who would now get the next bus.",2022,4,5

"I sold my diesel Fiat Panda in 2007, and have been without a car since. I take my work van home, so I don't need one to commute, and with supermarket deliveries I don't need to go shopping, so there wasn't any good reason to own it. I moved from a small town to the city centre, so I could walk everywhere.  
 
Some new neighbours moved in upstairs, and were so antisocial the police were called more than once - they advised me to move. It was good advice, but I hoped for something different. I moved to a suburb 9 years ago, still without a car. Buses aren't great, but sufficient. The local car club doesn't have anything nearby, I'd have to cycle or get a bus to the city centre to pick up a car, and since I'd already be in the city centre, what's the point?  
 
For a year I left the van at home and cycled to work, until I broke my face on the road (still not sure how that happened, but 6 weeks off work was nice!). Shortly after, my job changed and I was issued a much bigger van, with far too much stuff to carry on a bike, and having to drive further - from 10 or so to nearly 100. 
 
The company is starting to issue electric vans, but only if its easy to fit a charger. They refused to fit one at my house, so I'm doing it myself. Spending £2000 of my own money for work doesn't sit well, so I'm spending another £26,000 on an electric Corsa. Is that a sunk cost fallacy, or something else?  
 
I do have a reason to use a car now, every week I go to a friend's house for dinner, and he drives me back and forth. I persuaded him to try an EV, and he loves his MG5, but I'm worried about him driving at nearly midnight when he falls asleep in front of the TV. New work with less scope for getting the time off I want - the difference between a legacy job which is in decline, and won't be there at all in a few years, versus a growth industry where I can do as much overtime as I want, but have to book time off well in advance and can't get a whole week off at Christmas. The lockdown was the final straw, it was already difficult to use public transport to see my family 400 miles away. That won't be easy in an EV either, but I'll least I can travel on Christmas eve, and I'll be forced to stop so I won't fall asleep!",2022,4,5

Car sharing, public transport etc is a long-term objective but even that will be electric on the roads so EVs are the future regardless of whether we own them individually or collectively.

"It would be interesting to know how an EV stacks up environmentally against different forms of public transport. 
 
It is good to hear that some parts of the country are getting electric buses - around here it is still filthy diesel buses which might be better than an EV for the climate (are they?) but are horrendous for local air quality. 
 
I am lucky with my commute that the local train station is (just) within the GTE electric range, and work is within walking distance of the station at the other end. 
 
The train is electric so I'm happy with that, but if I were commuting in a different direction it would be diesel, and a very old Trigger's broom diesel at that. 
 
Heading North from here means Voyager diesel trains, which IIRC were flagged recently as producing much more real world emissions than on paper. Certainly from a local air quality perspective they are horrible when they go through the station. 
 
Just read a paper that suggests diesel trains average 100g CO2 / passenger km, ICE cars are about twice that, and the worst diesel trains are about the same CO2 / passenger km as an average ICE car.

I would like to have the option of public transport for my work journeys. It doesn’t exist - at least it doesnt exist in a way that is feasible. My 30 minute drive to work would become nearly 2 and a half hours of busses trains and whatnot. It just isn’t an option that’s realistic while continuing to do other things (studying etc). I feel that an EV is a sensible choice to  lessen  one’s impact, if not remove it. I will consider getting the train on periodic trips to Scotland or even driving to reduce my impact by not flying. I’m already a vegetarian which eliminates a big part of one’s carbon consumption balance. There are things we can do but there has to be some practical reality too. Some people simply can’t be without a car - there is no way for them to lead their lives without it.

There are many who are ambivalent or flat out don’t believe climate change exists - but there are a great many who do yet their options to reduce their impact are limited.

"And 2 days ago, on a 50 mph road (coming out of Cambridge), a taxi in front of me had his warnings lights on, he pulled to the left (half the car on the road), slowing down to a halt. I decided to indicate and take over when he suddenly pulled over and went right across the road to the property opposite. Another near miss, avoided by an inch. But at least he was apologetic, he didn't give me the finger.

Problems with the Leaf? Brake failure! I hesitate to pack my children in one of these... 
 
Problems with BMW i3? The rear drive and heavy regen braking confuses drivers and I'm sure the FWD generation would be in that group.

"@Biffa  thank you for your comment! Yes we have the Golf R here and it's insane. Your buddy's input re: e.golf is highly regarded!  
 
My cousin works for Hyundai US and I would LOVE the Ioniq EV alas they are a) sold out b) unavailable in my state. I may have to import one. I appreciate your idea about the CPO Tesla however I am thinking of a far lower price for a used car as close to $10,000 as possible. Some 2016 2017 e.golfs are very close! $14/15k.  
 
I just learned that the i3 actually has a rear motor, so that car could be a riot in the snow w/winter tires. I think I will leave it on my short list after all. Thanks. By the way Ioniq hybrid gets 57/59 mpg. I'm looking for full EV tho.",2019,4,9
"I think your comments re the e-golf clinch it, if they were available at that price in the UK many more people would be looking for them! 
 
Cheapest e-golf in the UK on  autotrader.co.uk  is £18k+ which looks reasonable, so higher than US, but not as bad as Denmark where a colleague was looking to buy a 3 year old E class cabriolet, car taxes are mental there and it comes in a £60k+.... no wonder so many ride bicycles! 
 
As an aside did Fiat not sell a 500e in California, can’t help but think that would have sold bucketloads in the EU at the right price.",2019,4,9
"You can easily find lower mileage 2016 SE models in the $10-12k range in California. SEL's for around 2k more. It may be worth it to buy one in CA and have it shipped back to Chicago for $1k.

"The ICE is at it's most efficient when it's up to running temperature, at this time of year for commuters that live in Bicester that is after they have left the town so we get left with all those lovely fumes as they are driving down the M40/A34, people who drive their kids to school are probably never getting their cars up to proper temperature so not only are they killing their kids they are also killing their cars, the irony is they drive them to school to keep them safe.....bizarre logic",2016,11,30

"Last year I emailed the council pointing out that HGV's were ignoring the restrictions and taking the relief roads and just continuing to take the direct route through Bicester contributing to the congestion and pollution, the response was that there was nothing they could do   why bother putting restrictions in place if your not going to enforce them. 
 
Another barmy idea was to introduce traffic calming measures by blocking one side of the road and forcing them to drive head on into the path of incoming traffic   this is as barmy as it gets, so now at bust times there are long queues of traffic waiting to drive down a road where the only restriction is a traffic island placed there at great expense by the council, all these cars are sitting there with their engines running and when they pull away they add even more to the pollution, after waiting for an inordinate length of time while the traffic continues to stream towards them they spot a gap and are forced to take their live into their hands and dive into the path of the oncoming traffic to get round the obstruction, it is the cause of lots of road rage incidents, I have been on the end of a few myself despite doing nothing wrong, you really couldn't make this up. 
 
The latest masterpiece of joined up thinking is to close the through route off altogether, yep that will work a treat, people driving even further to get to where they want to be will really help reduce the congestion and emissions. 
 
There is also another traffic calming measure at the bottom of the Churchill road, they have put a traffic island in the middle of the road so one side is narrow to stop wide vehicles getting through, the trouble is when they narrowed the gap on one side they made the gap on the other side wider, any prizes for guessing what the trucks do (and before anyone says anything I am aware that they can't block the road completely because emergency services have to be able to get through} but if they aren't going to enforce it why bother in the first place.",2016,11,30

Anyhow ... Now it is all clear 
 
Thanks 
 
PS: PHEV grow faster and are much bigger in size then BEV ... I think that more then the technology, the limitation is due to what market can offer ... possibly the PHEV success is mainly driven by few ""popular"" models ... BEV for mass market , may there is still not an ""ideal"" product in the market , or looking at Jan 2017 .. maybe it is just arrived and / or popular PHEV models are getting old 
 
PPS: I believe BEV is going to be a 2nd car for many years to come .. and a 2nd car, normally should cost under or around 10k as new .. and at the moment the cheaper is around 50% more expensive then this level. Anyhow ... will be interesting to see how much progress can make ZOE in 2017, which apparently is the BEV of this year. (If Fiat would offer the 500e in UK, I'm sure it will be sold like crazy)  
 
PPPS: Battery cost is the main handicap for PHEV and BEV .. at the moment it penalize more the BEV ... for instance Outlander PHEV now (since a while actually) cost like a Diesel version .. so at least one producer managed to make the magic to offer the PHEV at same price of a standard car.",2017,2,7
"Choice isn't doubling each year & range is still a factor , 
I suspect as the Gen 2 24-27Kwh cars morph into larger capacity battery range . 
late 2017 -2018 will be a big years with potentially new generation Leaf - Model 3 - longer range e-golf & an increase in Plug in petrol Hybrid cars . 
However the cars will still be niche 2% until regs sanctions & other penalties are implemented to force drivers away from diesel",2017,2,7
Choice isn't increasing as fast I thought. I have a Leaf (on my second) but now I need to think about replacing the ICE (Skoda Octavia Estate) so I'm on the look-out for a PHEV with a similar size. Popped in to Toyota and VW dealers yesterday and they had nothing to show me at all. I know a lot about the Outlander but I wanted to have a good look around before I get serious. I may just end up with a hybrid :-(,2017,2,7
Sounds like a hybrid Passat GTE Estate maybe?,2017,2,7
"I dont mind Hybrid sales booming, as it is going to need a huge cultural shift, a bit like cutting down smoking.... people taking the first step to electric (Hybrid) now fuel prices have not helped (remember £1.50 a litre) but they are starting to creep again.. £1.18 in Norfolk, higher price fuel is like the unseen sales man for EV, of course dealers actually have to give a shit",2017,3,6
"I am hoping other manufacturers, particularly Nissan, go down the rex route and the statistics are changed to show, Bev (pure electric), Bevx (Bev +Rex), Phev (plug-in hybrid) and then Hybrids.

"Simple answer... Tesla. 
The really wealthy are waiting on thier S or X.  
All the wealthy(eg poorer than those that can afford an S) people are waiting on the 3, they know tesla will deliver. (so hanging on to what they have)  
All the manufacturers are waiting on the 3 to see if EV cars are thing they want to do properly. (so no new EVs) 
 
And in the meantime they want 215mile EVs... So they buy an outlander or an i3rex.  
 
And everyone else is waiting on the second hand cars to devalue(due to the 3) so they can afford one.",2017,3,6
"To the question why are sales as they are? I believe the model 3 promises, and the fact tesla actually seem to deliver on thier promises has a major effect. 
 
Where as even Nissan seem he'll bent on keeping thier EVs ugly for some reason...Hyundai keep them out off pcp, kia ugly and delayed. BMW compromised, Renault insistence on rentals... GM won't even sell them. Only mitsubishi delivery a proper car, and thats a phev and I suspect an accidental success.... 
 
Its like watching a game of poker where all but but one of the player keep folding in case that player has somthing amazing up thier sleeve, so he keeps winning by default, scooping the initally bet over and over. 
 
Its not hard to win a game nobody else is playing.",2017,3,6
"@Marli  Personally I think it's daft to think this lull in EVs is because people are waiting for Model 3.  
 
The fastest growing sector is fleet sales. These guys' bread and butter is low lease cost and low BIK rates. Fleet buyers aren't in the queues waiting for pre-orders. They want their cars yesterday. 
 
In the next year or so the only way to do that is discounted low CO2 diesels, augmented with a further push on newer PHEVs. 
 
Not that it's a bad thing, PHEV growth = increased battery demand = better supply chains = more pure EV range (hopefully into pure EV only range)",2017,3,6
"@John Riley  I wonder if it's to do with the upcoming BIK changes. If the list price of a hybrid is much lower than the list price of an equivalent PHEV, then the latter becomes less attractive. 
 
We could also be seeing significant off loading of ""old stock"" hybrids, as the manufacturers look to run them out before they bring in PHEVs. For fleet cars this can make huge differences to the effective monthly rentals. 
 
Personally I get a distinct feeling that business optimism in 2016 was at it's highest I've seen for a long time, and many businesses were going into growth mode, employing more people and giving out more cars, as well as refreshing older cars that had been held longer waiting for growth. Both could have caused a cyclical bump in car sales across the board.  
 
One other factor is this optimism lead to small business owners, probably the ideal target for PHEVs rather than larger company fleets, already having renewed last year. 
 
It will be interesting to see what happens post April.",2017,3,7
"Considering the majority of EV sales are a particular low-range PHEV that does 15-20 electric miles on a 80% it seems reasonable to say the sales figures of the last 2 years have masked what is really in truth, relatively low overall volume of electric driving.",2017,3,8
"I think people are seeing that PHEV isn't that much of a benefit - limited electric range and in the case of the Mitsi they're not very economical on petrol alone. 
 
Hybrids becoming easier to sell - their reported mpg figures are a lot easier to interpret for those coming from pure ICE cars. Toyota dealer every 25 miles makes servicing / warranty easy. Prius is more ugly than ever but the C-HR range seems to be selling like hot cakes.",2017,4,5
"Nissan have clearly had a very good month with the LEAF - whether through forum sales or their electric month promotions. 
 
Ioniq numbers will be starting to show a bit more now too",2017,4,5
"I disagree with the seeing PHEV are not so much of a benefit. It suits some people very well. I did get 5k off mine though, and the grant has gone down a lot. From now on, there is also a £140/year VED on top, which won't help the case either.",2017,4,5
You may have a point there  @John Riley  and they qualify for the £4500 PICG. They probably need £140/year VED from now on though :/,2017,4,5
"I've recently been round the dealers to look at replacing by Skoda Octavia estate. 
Toyota: no Prius on show, salesman said it is currently being replaced with a new model. The PHEV ""...was 30 miles on electric, but the new one is only 12 miles"" (?). 
VW: clueless, took 10 minutes to find a salesman, no info on Passat PHEV. 
Neither dealer took my contact details - it appears as though dealers are there to discourage you from buying.",2017,4,5

It's not because hybrids are cheaper as the other day while I was waiting for my train to depart from the station. I was looking at a Yaris hybrid advertising and its headline price was the same as I paid for our Zoe Q90i. Now I have nothing against the Yaris but by the time you put a year's worth of petrol in it the Zoe starts to become cheaper in comparison.,2017,6,6

I was always amazed at the drivers who would pay much more for a car just so they got zero road tax. It would not surprise me if a fair number of the increase in BEV sales is purely down to that now. People are strange.,2017,6,7
"Agreed  @Mark Cornwall  the money people spunk on flash motors and complain about the road tax. 
Don't get me wrong I think it is just the feeling of paying a duty which we all know doesn't go to what it was originally designed for but isn't it often the way.",2017,6,7
"Oh, I can see the comments sections ablaze yet further, ""EVs can't survive without my taxes paying for middle class greenies! NOW I'M PAYING FOR THEIR ROAD TAX?!?!?!?!?""",2017,6,8
"Or just abolish road tax and put in a per mile road pricing system on all roads, with a higher rate in towns and a big discount for EVs....... The problem with the current system is that car ownership costs too much, but car usage costs too little.",2017,6,8
"Agreed. If I could keep my Astra on my driveway for the odd longer trip at a cost of near zero, I'd be a lot more likely to have an EV as a second car for my daily commute. The system as it stands discourages me from owning 2 cars, so I'm trying to find a car that suits both types of journey, and that's a lot harder to do. The cost of car ownership is discouraging miles from becoming EV miles. 
 
In this scenario, I'd have 2 cars, but only ever be driving one of them (the other would sit on my drive not bothering anybody). So IMO an easy solution is to make fixed costs of ownership PER PERSON rather than PER CAR.",2017,6,8

"With diesel getting such bad press and not only the model 3 but also the Jaguar i pace and Gen 3 Leaf, I believe we are getting towards the perfect storm. Then there are new PHEV'S coming to market on a regular basis now. One thing that could also accelerate plugin sales would be if VW actually got behind their good range of electrified cars and started to advertise them.",2017,7,5
"Yes, it must be on the turn. My friend, who would not even talk to me about EVs last year has now asked me which EV he should buy. Then he was turned off by all the faff of charging. Now he has come to realise that it normally takes place on your drive and overnight. He even discuss where the charger was going on the wall.",2017,7,5
"For there to be a significant increase the battery production has to be increased, current output limits growth. Also need to ensure supply of magnets when there is competition from wind generators.",2017,7,5
"Tesla motors seem to be a standard brushless motor, rotating magnets in wound coil.",2017,7,6
"Three months ago I was in the market for a new car. Started by looking at SUVs which nearly all seemed to be diesel and ended up getting 30kWh Leaf Tekna on a 2 year PCP.  
Why? Although the Leaf is far from an ideal car in terms of range I just don't want to drive a vehicle that spews out toxic fumes that kill people for the convenience of range. 
I think the combination of news flow on the state of pollution along our roads combined with the new 200 mile plus pure electric cars on the horizon mean that we will see the ""S curve"" for alternative fuelled vehicles rise rapidly now. 
We just need some leadership from the government on the charging infrastructure. Even after a few months of electric driving I can see it is a mess and market forces alone are not delivering a coherent strategic transport resource, let alone dealing with how the grid will cope with mass adoption.",2017,8,4

"What are you talking about? One is (what I can only assume) an ICE car with lots of gears, pistons, and clutch in the middle. 
 
The other is an electric motor on 4 wheels. Basically a pulley. The drive mode only changes the mapping applied to the go pedal and nothing more. Your batteries might be affected long term from the way you use them, like harsh acceleration or deep discharge, but not the drive mode. The batteries will be protected by the BMS, to the best of the manufacturer's ability.",2022,10,28
"I sold a Fiat 126 to some crusties many years ago. 
It had been running very well but there were signs of wear on the rubber links on the halfshafts so I included them for free. 
When crustyF was test driving the car she refused to give it enough revs and thus there was a lot of vibration so I explained she needs to keep the revs up, that's how many of these cars are and she would cause more damage than do good if she didn't keep the engine running along nicely. 
I went round the car and made sure all the tinware was solidly done up as she had vibrated a couple of the shorter screws loose. 
I said she could replace those with longer ones and use a split washer or similar to keep them firm but I had not had issues with them as I kept it running smooth with a few more revs. 
 
She agreed to buy the car and agreed to keep the revs up. 
 
2 days later CrystyM phoned me and wanted their money back as the window had fallen out. 
 
He then went on to threaten to stab me, suffice to say that for whatever reason she had not revved the poor thing.

"ICE have peak torque at 3500 rpm  
 
your dad wasn't really talking about low RPM, he was talking about gearing 
 
ride a bike at low rpm up a hill in 1st gear and force needed from your legs is low as is the stress on your legs 
 
ride a bike at low rpm up a hill in 18th gear and the force your legs need to put into the pedals, chain, bearings etc is huge and will cause damage. 
 
clearly in an EV if you stamp on the throttle at every opportunity then the stresses will be higher than smooth application 
 
BUT an electric motor reaches Maximum torque almost instantly - so the gearing is designed for that.

"That picture is like a poster to stick up on the wall under the heading ""avoid"". 
If they would listen to customer feedback and do a bit of a quality check on cars before they left the factory there would be a huge improvement. 
Recently Vx prices have shot up and they now seem to want far more than the car is actually worth. If they realised that they are in the budget car sector and nothing they do is premium and then focused on getting things up to spec rather than fobbing people off with poor quality and refusing to help when a customer experiences issues that should never have arisen then they might be in a position they want. 
Right now they are just a huge dissapointment, especially from the Vx side of things.

"I was having a think about the subtle and not so subtle ways car manufacturers are trying to hold back the sale of EVs. Some I think is deliberate, others a happy coincidence they won't do anything about. 
 
Toyota: Adverts showing how you don't need to use a charger if you have a hybrid. Also calling the Lexus NX300h a ‘self charging hybrid’ inferring benefits of EV without charging hassle. Miss-direction by going down the H2 fuel cell route. Terrible EV mileage on the plug in Prius (compliance car). 
 
Nissan: Holding back on larger batteries and quirky 'marmite' design. 
 
VW: Advertising the GTE with the ICE as giving you the 'exciting' boost, inferring that 'boring' electricity does the rest. Selling the eGolf with only 80miles of range (BTW 2 blokes in their garage created a 200mile version). Uninformed sales staff who will redirect you away from EVs. eTron with terrible EV miles (compliance car). 
 
BMW: Quirky i3 design, high servicing costs, lobbying Hong Kong Govt away from EV only sales incentives 
 
Kia Soul: Quirky design, low range 
 
Fiat: The Chairman pleading with people not to buy the eFiat500. 
 
GM: Not following on from the Ampera in a serious way in the U.K. Where is the Bolt? 
 
Hyundai: Pricing the IONIQ plug-in hybrid $5k lower than the EV (How does an extra ICE drivetrain cost less than an extra 19kWh of batteries?) 
 
All manufacturers: 
Blinding/distracting consumers with 'jam tomorrow' concept cars. 
Software limiting acceleration (EVs cannot be seen to beat their expensive cash cows, can they?). 
Paying 'think tanks' or funding research to show EVs as producing more brake and tire dust. 
High servicing costs relative to work involved. 
Long lead build times in spite of high demand (eg ZOE 6 months, ICONQ 8-10 months, Golf GTE taken off market).

Lexus. Advertising their hybrids as Self Charging!,2017,11,16

This is infuriating as without the contracts for supply a large planned production run would bring, the battery manufacturers (eg LG and Samsung in SK) can't invest in larger battery production facilities which would bring further economies of scale.

Some manufacturers are better than others at this. Kia/Hyundai seem to be about the best. Stellantis (Vauxhall, Peugeot, Fiat, etc) seem to be about the worst. 
 
I don't know how it works on the Megane but in the Zoe if you reset the trip counter it will cause things to recalculate, but it still isn't immediate. 
 
As weather is warmer and conditions improve you will find you can get a higher miles/kWh from the car and so the indicated range will increase... but it's always a guess.",2023,3,22

If you charge to 100% then do that you'll see after a couple of miles driving you'll get a more accurate representation of your efficiency.

"What use case do you use the car for? 
Lots of short journeys or long ones? 
There are lots of reasons why short journeys are not representative of long run range. One example for example a long run down the motorway at 60mph will warm the battery up making it much more efficient than the same overall distant covered at 30 to 40mph in many trips.  
In the winter I get much better mpkwh doing a longer faster journey than my short trips around town",2023,3,22

"With my old Zoe I would always reset the range on long journeys so I would know if I would make my next charge stop or not. 
 
However the Megane estimates how much charge you will have left and I have found it very accurate on the Google maps, so don't reset as often as I used to as I don't need to anymore. 
 
However I have noticed even at Zero percent it still has about 20 miles of range left as proven by Tesla Bjorn. This is a big improvement on the Zoe, as you could never get the full mileage out of the car as you were dipping into its reserve buffer, so always had to keep 10 -12 miles of extra range in hand to prevent it going into limp mode. 
 
That means you can basically drive it down to Zero percent and still have the buffer if you need it, generally I would only recommend doing this on your return journey home as you know you will be able to charge, as long as you have home charging! 
 
As I always do when getting a new EV, I have already run the Megane down to 5% and still had full power available, even though the GOM disappeared at 10 miles remaining to the ""Double Dash"" of mystery! ",2023,3,24

"Hello. Want to buy an EV or possibly a hybrid and don't want to spend more than £20k. Would consider buying a second hand (1 yr to 18months), if it meant I could buy a better car with more tech options, better interior etc. I'm not a ""car snob"" and see them only as an aid in getting from A to B, but want some comfort. I have done a little bit of online research and would love to go totally EV, but am a bit frightened about the mileage range currently available, so the BMW i3 sounds interesting. I would ideally love a 5 seater, so the Nissan Leaf appeals on that front and hear they are very popular. The Renault Zoe also appeals budget wise. I currently drive a Toyota, but can't understand why their hybrids are so expensive. I hear that Hyundai are bringing out an EV very soon (perhaps already out?); does anyone know anything about that? I normally wouldn't spend as much as an EV costs, but feel that we inevitably will all be driving them in the near future and am keen to do my tiny bit to save the planet (ar**holes to Trump!). I love the Fiat 500 style-wise and hear they have made an e-version, which is only available in California & Oregon in order to comply with those States' green laws (they are ignoring Trump). Does anyone know if they may be available in the UK soon? Also can anyone tell me why EV'S depreciate so much, so quickly after purchase and will buying a 2nd hand one help with that?

"Hi Jan and Welcome.  
 
The Leaf and Zoe have large discounts and finance contributions, so the depreciation isn't  quite  as bad as it appears! A lot of people buy on PCP so know exactly how much it will cost and don't have to worry if residuals get worse.  
 
It will probably help members provide more focused advise if you explain how much you drive each day, how many longer drives you do (with examples) and confirm you have private, off street parking.",2017,7,1
"Hello  @Jan Morris   
 
Welcome to the forum, it's a great community on here so i'm sure you will find shortly some other members will give great advice! In regards to your price budget and the age of vehicle you want, you have got quite a bit of choice which is good. As you have mentioned the i3 is a great vehicle and sounds like could be an option for you, whether you decide to go for an i3 with the REX (Range Extender) or the BEV version (Battery Electric Vehicle) would depend on your daily journeys and types of commutes, in most incidences a BEV i3 could be suitable but its always an added luxury to have the assurances of the range extender! What is your typical daily journey? The i3 Rex will do realistically 70-80 miles on electric and another 70-80 miles using the petrol giving you a combined range of 150 miles. One thing you will find if your daily mileage is low, you will only find yourself charging up a couple times a week. So its good to remember if you decided to charge everyday (overnight) you wake up in the morning and the car has got 100% and you can carry out another 80-100 miles etc.  
 
The Nissan leaf is one of the most popular electric vehicles on the market, you have a good choice on the used car market and yes they have the 5 seats compared to the i3 which has just 4 seats. When looking at the Leaf's or Zoe's keep an eye out whether they are battery owned or battery lease, I wont go to much into detail about this but preferably if you can buy a battery owned vehicle this is better. There are many threads talking about this.  
 
The Fiat 500 yes these are in america, I do not anticipate these coming to the UK anytime soon. Unless other forum members have heard different.  
 
Buying a second hand EV is a great way of getting into an electric vehicle at an affordable price. I run an independent electric vehicle specialists based in Camberley, Surrey. I will put a link to my website at the bottom. On there you will be able to see a few different EV's I have got for sale and at various price-points. Your more than welcome to give me a call anytime and ask as many questions as you like. Hope this helps, I'm sure some others will be along shortly to give there great advice also.

"As  @andrew*debbie  says, cash is no longer king in the car world! Almost all purchases are financed, so people compare repayments rather than cash price. This means that dealers often offer better deals on finance! Even on used, Nissan offer £1000 towards finance but you could take out and pay off almost immediately. 
 
The UK has far more plug in cars than France, so I am not sure why you think it would be better there? There are threads here on people taking EVs to mainland Europe including a recent one in an i3 REX.  
 
A charger with a 13A plug (not included with Zoe) is really intended for when visiting family and friends as all manufacturers encourage the fitting of a dedicated charger. With Zoe and Leaf a dedicated charger is free thanks to manufacturers and the OLEV grant. Relying on just a 13A charger is also risky - if it failed you would not be able to charge you car at home, but it is good as a backup.",2017,7,2
"Welcome to SpeakEV  @Jan Morris . 
 
Having just bought a one-month-old used Leaf, I can say with certainty that there are huge savings to be made buying a nearly new Leaf for cash from a Nissan dealer, getting all the warranty benefits, etc of buying from a franchised dealer.  
 
You would be well within your budget and I think now is a great time to buy because dealers are scratching around for deals before the new registration plate in September. Do an Autotrader search on 2017 electric cars to confirm – you'll see there are plenty of nearly new Leafs with low mileages available currently. 
 
I suggest you start showing interest on a specific car around the middle of the month and make a sporty bid on the car you'd like, being very clear that you will take delivery this month and there are other cars that meet your requirements available. If the dealer doesn't accept very quickly then try a different dealer. 
 
I've taken the 80/20 approach to choosing my new car. My Leaf will do 80% of the things I need and I'll find other ways of doing the rest (e.g. Uni runs, fly/drive to France, etc.) which will cost me less than if I'd chosen a different car. 
 
The other point I'd make about depreciation is that many of the people buying EVs are very tech-orientated and want the latest model with the newest features so there has been an oversupply of used cars. From an owner perspective, most of these cars were financed on PCP deals so the owners haven't taken a big financial hit – quite the contrary they will have saved money compared to running a petrol/diesel car. 
 
If you buy used, to a large extent, the depreciation will be offset by your saving in fuel costs. When thinking through how to replace my first Leaf, and wanting more range, I couldn't face the depreciation plus the cost of petrol for 10,000 miles per year! That's what put me off Toyota hybrids! 
 
As others have said, get a dedicated charging point installed near to where you park your car at home.",2017,7,2
"Hello again Lewis, sorry I am late getting back to you - got back late from day out yesterday. 
 
Your reply was very helpful - beginning to build up some useful information which will help me decide which brand and model to go for. I do very low mileage in the week, but a bit more at weekends, but no more than about 6k a year on average. I may not need the BMW i3 REX, but would like to test drive one to make sure. The Nissan Leaf sounds more me than the Zoe and I like the idea of the extra space, but I can park anywhere with my current car (Aygo) and so a larger car might be a bit of a shock. I keep hearing of other cars about to come on the market (think all manufacturers must be really pulling all the stops out now as so many more people in the UK now seem to be turned onto the thought of buying EVs) -  Six new electric cars coming for 2018 and 2019  
 
I will arrange some test drives locally this week as I don't really fancy driving to Surrey to be honest and I would prefer to deal with a local dealer for convenience, but may be in touch if I can't find a good deal. It's always been difficult buying a new car as I do find a lot of sales people unwilling to do a good deal with a woman, which is why I may take a male friend with me in the hope that sales staff will not be patronising and will offer me a better price. Thank you very much again though for replying to me and for the useful info. May be in touch.",2017,7,3
"Here's my ""off the wall"" punt. A cheap second hand leaf on a £130 down and £130 per month PCP for 2 years and rent a very cheap car if you need to go more than 200 miles in one day which will probably boil down to a few days per year. That will leave you the thick end of £17000 in the bank. Interest of £1.72 after tax over the next few years and put a deposit on a Tesla M3. That will do all your mileage requirement and be a very cool car. You can justify the PCP payments by the fuel savings WHEN your mileage triples to 15k pa due to enjoying driving again now you are in an EV.  
 
On a more seriously note, a cheap PCP as above would be a good starter if you dont do much mileage and perhaps want to dip your toe in the EV market to see if it works for you wit current cars available. A PCP would avoid you loosing loads on depreciation when the new 200 mile models come out in the next few years; late this year for the leaf. In 2 years time you could buy the PCP leaf outright quite cheaply and it wont have cost much more than using cash now or walk away if resale values have tanked due to 200 mile range cars. You could use it as a deposit for a 2018 40kWh+ leaf if there is any equity which is unlikly. A Nissan dealer may play ball and give you something if they want to reach a sales target.  
 
I too was very much a buy cash sort of person but the PCP rates on EV's are comparable with fuel saving costs so it is as close to a free car as you will get. ie. 5k pa in a 35mpg ice will cost you about £65 per month + £12.50 + tax so close to £80pcm in running costs (no depreciation). £130 + (£15 per month electricity) gets you a leaf and running costs and a known depreciation. You will not find any car that is a 64-15 plate that will depreciate less than £65 per month.

"Hi Jan, 
Not sure of your time scales. But the Milton Keynes Electric Vehicle Experience Center (EVEC) is due to open this month on the 22 nd. It is impartial and will be set up using government funding to allow people to find out about EV's from a number of car makers. Cheap rental for trying out cars is also available. If you are reasonably local could be very informative. At the moment things are changing all the time that is why I ended up with a two year deal on the I3 REX 94AH. The range extender is the best thing since EV's really makes driving an ""EV"" a pleasure with the current state of public chargers.
