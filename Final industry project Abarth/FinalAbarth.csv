"Anyone else notice this. 
 
Neither Zoe nor Tesla even make the list. The 1 & 2 cars from 2016 and not a single person reviewed their car? 
 
For one I know I completed the review this year, and I know a couple of other folk that reviewed before closing date. And yet Zoe isn't on the list at all. 
 
I'm not screaming fix, but its really odd the 2 highest placed cars are nowhere, and that both scored higher last year than this years winner (a Skoda, in a magazine famously heavily sponsored by VAG and SHELL). 
 
So can we have a show of hands for who voted for 2017.",2017,6,8

Volkswagen up! Mk1",2017,6,8
Are you saying that the ZOE topped the reliability polls last year?  I've done a quick search and can't see anything about it.,2017,6,8
"They need a certain number off entrant's 
Or Ampera would be top",2017,6,8
"Electric cars dominate Driver Power 2016, the UK’s biggest car satisfaction survey",2017,6,8
"How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands! 
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today. 
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range. 
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc.  
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no  problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk. 
 
Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly. 
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV. 
 
And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster) 
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that. 
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that! 
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise. 
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one.  
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?%  
 
As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ. This is to inform people who may be interested in this car but unable to sample one for themselves at this time. Look forward to other reviews from you all at some point!",2021,4,24
"Nice review, I am having a test drive on Tuesday, can I ask what sort of discounts were offered, see we were both looking at the Ioniq 5 on an other forum.",2021,4,24
I saw Jonny Smith’s early review of this and thought it looked great.,2021,4,24
I work in the NHS and with their finance package -Affinity? Would give a £2k discount Straight off For NHS workers. I Will have to read up on it. New car/new model but I am sure as Fiat dealers they can still do a deal.,2021,4,24
"I noticed this site seems to have some really good prices - £23.5k for the La Prima hatch. No connection and I've never used them before, so can't vouch for them.",2021,4,24
"We’ve also got our test drive on Tuesday. Car has been on order now for over a year now and Mrs is very excited, especially after reading this review. As I said on another thread, I think Fiat have got this spot on.",2021,4,25
"Forgot to mention the excellent turning circle (not quite Honda-e or BMW i3 small but almost and still great so this city car is easily manoeuvrable.  
And surprised by the high quality of the rear view park camera. Pin sharp/high resolution/colourful. Compared to our newish e-208 which has a pretty low res rear view camera.I was just surprised by the all round quality of the Fiat.  
And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell! 
 
Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.",2021,4,25
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.,2021,4,25
Did you find the start up chimes/sound and low speed sounds to be irritating? Or aren’t they that noticeable?,2021,4,25
Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.,2021,4,25
"Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.",2021,4,26
Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now ,2021,4,26
"Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.",2021,4,27
"What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm.  
 
Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.",2021,4,27
"We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything  @MarkyM  said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks… 
 
Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.",2021,4,27
Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.,2021,5,21
"i have a problem. The problem is I love cheap sports cars, having owned Nissan 350z's and Toyota Celicas in the past, but after following climate change science I've decided to reduce my carbon emissions as much as possible and there doesn't seem to be very much on the market to fill the gap. I have my zero emission Leaf which is brilliant, but it's obviously not sporty. And if you do drive it briskly you end up at a charge point sooner than expected  . I'd love to buy a Tesla (roadster or model S), but they are outside of my price range especially as a second car. i3 Rex is a possibility, but it's not really designed as a sports car and a bit on the expensive side for what I'm thinking of.  
 
It's a shame toyota didn't put a tuned Prius 1.8L hybrid system in a new Celica or Mazda/Honda couldn't do something with a range extender In their small sports cars. I've always fancied an American muscle car such as the Mustang they are bringing over here this year, but I'm guessing it's not going to be less than 50g/km!  
 
I'm looking forward to when zero and low emission vehicles are available across all the different vehicle types, but the car industry seems to be a little on the conservative side in this arena at the moment. Maybe I just want my cake and eat it ",2015,6,8
"Honda Insight? 
 
Tesla Roadster?",2015,6,8
Use the Leaf in the week and then buy a cheap lotus Elise or similar for your weekend fun and don't worry about the emissions.,2015,6,8
"Honda CR Z Hybrid? 
 
 Honda CR-Z Review | Auto Express",2015,6,8
"How about a Smart Roadster, or a Mazda MX5 or Even a MGB conversion. Happy to oblige if anyone is intersted.",2015,6,8
"I'd have suggested Smart Roadster and CRZ too. The former may have reliability issues (electrics can give problems), the latter as you say is not the fastest. 
 
The last model MR2 was pretty economical and has all the best sports car traits - two seats and no luggage space to speak of at all!",2015,6,8
Op I know exactly how you feel! I love my Zoe but I am soooo tempted to buy a cheap roadster. I have had 2 xmk3 MR2 and they are the most fun you can have with your clothes on.,2015,6,8
"Oops, when I said Honda Insight I was picturing the CRZ ",2015,6,8
"I had the same problem but solved it by getting a Fiat 500T, but you could go up to the 500 Abarth if you want a bit more.",2015,6,8
"There are several MX5, S2000 and Elise conversions out there...",2015,6,8
I was but dang that Mustang does look nice   if they did a BEV or PHEV version id be all over it,2015,6,9
"Had a great day at FC live in Harrogate on Friday. Lots to see and chat to people about, both cars, connectivity and general EV stuff. Great showing from .Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, BYD, Polestar, Tesla and Ora where you could test drive and / or pick up information. But where were the European offerings? There was a token static Fiat 500, an Astra, an MG4 but with no POS or datacapture.. Complacent or just not interested? Opportunity missed, methinks! Wake up!",2023,5,21
"They are all in their padded cells, gently rocking back and forth mumbling something like ….“missed the boat…missed the boat” or some such thing, having just got back from the Shanghai motor show……….",2023,5,21
"I went on Saturday hoping to sit in a Jaguar I-pace and citroen ec4 but as you say both manufacturers were absent, it was a bit disappointing. What was there changed my mind about particular cars from just 30 seconds in the seat, bases or backs too narrow, not enough space between steering wheel and floor at highest rake etc.",2023,5,21
"On the recent FC podcast, on YT, they talked about their most asked question. ""Where is X car maker?"" They invited everybody. They said they would list all the companies asked but refused to come, who not only turned down paid for space but even the opportunity to display a car for free. Draw your own conclusions.",2023,5,22
The McMurtry Speirling Fan car was my favourite 😎,2023,5,22
"Also got lots of interest in my Renault Megane in the carpark, guess Renault missed a trick there not attending the show 😄",2023,5,22
"I was at the show on Saturday and found it to be ok. Not quite as wide ranging as Id expected with many major (legacy) brands not on show. 
 
The highlights for me were seeing the Ioniq6 in the flesh and the EV6 GT, the latter being my next expected purchase however the Ioniq6 looks really really good, great too to see the 6 in a couple of different colours. It might be the one to get when the 'N' variant is launched instead of the EV6 GT. 
 
Bar that, me and my buddy who was disappointed at the lack of home solutions on display were done and dusted in 90 mins. in truth, we couldve been finished in an hour if wasnt for wanting to listen to a talk involving EVM. 
 
Still though, it was a great excuse to get out into the sunshine and overall we were glad we went.",2023,5,22
"Fisker were at FC-S were they at FC-N? Did Ford not rock up with an F-150 EV?

I guess if you went and wanted a normal 'motor' show then I can see why you may have been less than impressed.",2023,5,22
"Hi all, 
 
Will I be mad to not test drive before ordering? I went to my local dealer today and sat in the car and am 100% certain that I’ll be opting for a 4+ because the financial maths works out very well for me, as well as the BIK saving over ICE I will be paid an extra £150 per month for electing to take a lower band vehicle than my entitlement. 
 
I didn’t test drive my last 2 company ICE cars, having never driven those makes previously, both have been absolutely fine and no regrets. If it makes a difference I don’t do m(any) work miles and so the car will be 95% personal local mileage. 
 
I’ve read that driving an EV is MUCH different to ICE so do I need a test drive to learn the basics of driving an EV or can I ‘teach myself’ when it’s delivered? 
 
Sorry if this is a silly question but test driving a car is something that I’ve never done before!",2021,5,23
"Nope not mad. I ordered blind and had never sat in one, just a Niro hybrid. 
 
Very little to learn about driving it other than getting a feel for the responsiveness in the first 30mins assuming you're in anything other than Eco Mode. Just a fun ride.",2021,5,23
You clearly don't care much about cars so why bother? EVs are functional so it will do the job as well as ICE. The main thing is to learn about the various means of charging it and the realistic range.,2021,5,23
"Thanks both, as I’ve got older I do indeed care less about cars but before the company cars I owned a Fiat 500 Abarth (and other similar type hot hatches before that) so I’m not totally ambivalent! 
 
My decision this time is 90% about the money  Actually, no, it’s 100% about the money",2021,5,23
"The best thing is that you are making an excellent choice even if for the ""wrong"" reasons. Most on here would argue about the choice of which EV because that's what we do. ",2021,5,23
"Why not take the test drive anyway? 
It takes an hour and an hour is worth wasting for a 4 year commitment. 
 
I won’t say that you can’t go wrong with one, although the e-Niro is a very good car that deserves more representation.",2021,5,23
"I didn’t know that, thanks.",2021,5,23
"SueH and I are in the same locale, the dealer in Southampton/Portsmouth just lets you get on with it. Nicely placed to get onto a motorway so that in an hour and a half you can try it in all conditions. They do hang on to your own car, or bike in Sue’s case for security!",2021,5,23
"My E-Niro 4 is the first car I've bought without a test drive, having previously had an automatic it wasn't so very different. If you are coming from a manual then yes it might seem strange at first, but then so would an ICE automatic. The wealth of tech is daunting, so just go for simple at first and gradually expand your knowledge. I've had mine in ECO mode since I've had it, and it has plenty of performance for me.",2021,5,23
"I didn’t have a test drive and my e Niro is here for five years. It’s slightly smaller than I expected, but otherwise drives fine, comfortable, functional.",2021,5,24
"Had a 45 minute test drive, never driven an automatic, stopped on my drive to show the wife, couldn’t get it to start to drive again. Wife says foot on brake to start doh. 18 months later car arrived and it’s the best car I’ve ever had.",2021,5,24
"Testing is usually confusing. Beds, sofas, cars can't be accurately assessed by a 30 minute sample, but only by living with them.",2021,5,24
"I’ve committed to a few cars without driving them over the years. I find that reading reviews gives me a pretty good idea of what I’m letting myself in for.  
 
I would only have concerns about going for a smaller/cheaper/less “premium” car than I’ve been used to without driving it first. If you’re going the other way there shouldn’t be too much to worry about.",2021,5,24
"I ordered my leased e-Niro 2 purely on the info I'd read about and seen in various YouTube reviews. No test drive, and I'd never even seen on in the flesh. 
No regrets whatsoever - lovely to drive and very comfortable.",2021,5,24
"Why is your company even providing any car, let alone an EV, if you ""don’t do m(any) work miles "" and don't seem particularly interested in cars or the environment? I understand it is 'part of the package', but wouldn't higher basic pay be simpler and give employees options to get whatever transport solution best meets their requirements. Or is it all just a jolly tax wheeze?",2021,5,24
"Looks like this “electric car” has exhaust pipes. 
 
i cant find anywhere to report this…should I even bother?",2022,10,28
"There's no point, in clean air zones the ARPNs have access to DVLA's emission data. which ignore the colour. In fact there's zero advantage to having a green flash on the plate, other than bragging right and invitation to be bullied by anti-EV drivers.",2022,10,28
"I think everyone should. The illegal use of those plates devalues the purpose of them. Also prevents any possible introduction of benefits using those plates. (eg. those that can't validate zero emission status by imminently access APRN database) 
 
The driver may also be thinking they are driving an EV, but in actual fact they are driving a hybrid. 
 
I saw an Fiat 500 Abarth with green plates on A40 a few months ago. Unfortunately due to heavy traffic I didn't try to get behind to capture it with my dashcam. If I had similar quality photo, I'll be looking to report the car.",2022,10,28
I'm just surprised that the plate doesn't appear to be personalised or have illegal spacing etc!,2022,10,28
Just take pleasure in the fact that the number plate appears to have been fitted at a wonky angle.,2022,10,28
It’s an electric hybrid with a 1998cc engine producing 31g/km. Aren’t they allowed the green flash?,2022,10,28
"Do you have a few hours to waste? If so, Yes.  
If not, don't worry too much about it. The green flash has no useful meaning. 
 
However, it may be worthwhile looking up who made up that plate, and report THEM to the DVLA, because by law in the UK, they have to check the V5c registration certificate to determine fuel type and it should be 'electric' or 'hydrogen fuel-cell' to get that green flash. If they're not checking the V5c, including the purchaser's identity, before issuing the plate, then they could be aiding and abetting a host of other crimes. It's a case of 'low-hanging fruit' that leads to other things. Fitting non-compliant plates is a gateway drug to other crimes, for both the issuer of the plates, and the keeper of the vehicle.",2022,10,28
"This may be an error on the part of the dealer. 
 
I took delivery of a PHEV a couple of months back and when at the dealership concentrated on checking paint, panel gaps etc., rather than the reg plates. It was later that day when I had parked the car and was walking past it that I noticed that it had green plates. I wasn't going to go back to the dealer about reg plates!",2022,10,28

"One possible real-life benefit of the green flash could be educating traffic wardens to ticket drivers for ICEing chargers. 
The flash would mean they wouldn't have to check a database to see if a specific car is an EV.",2022,10,28
"Green flash is pointless in my opinion. 
 
I thought the stated reason for the green flash was only to raise awareness of BEVs. It would be useless for any official purpose as it would be so easy to fake. A bit of green insulating tape could be added and removed in seconds. 
 
i confess I never look for them nor notice them. I recognise the cars rather than a small green flash on the number plate. For our Soul, we just let the dealer decide. 
 
I don’t see why EVs should be allowed in bus lanes, be given parking privileges or be exempt congestion charges, they take up the same space. ULEZ exemption is fair enough but they will go when almost all vehicles are low emission. The ”encouragement” to get an EV will be driven by the ban on new ICE but, from what I have read on the forum, there are not enough EVs to meet demand anyway.",2022,10,28
"As per the title, I'm not sure I actually like the Zoe ZE40 overall. Before I do something drastic after only 6 months of ownership then I thought I'd better sense check to see if some of the things that bug me are might actually be easily fixed. 
 
Background - my first EV but I'd wanted one for years, liked it on the short test drive of standard but ended up buying an S Edition 186 miles away because I wanted the part leather and a different colour than white.   
I didn't actually expect to like the Zoe, just drove it more to explore all limited options and it surprised me in a good way at the time. 
 
My main gripes that bother me are; 
The ride - I didn't notice on the test drive, but the ride/handling is a major gripe. Feels too soft or missing an anti-roll bar at the front and waaaay too stiff at the rear, to the point where going over bumps even at low speed causes me back pain... and I haven't had back issues for 30 years.  
 
The car really wants to rear-end another car - the brakes seem somewhat unpredictable compared to normal braking systems. If I brake or slow gently (guessing just on regen) then when I reach about 8mph the car decides it wants to surge forward, just when you're coming close to a car behind and you then have to re-apply considerably more brake. This is fairly consistent but at the same time variable in severity depending on pedal pressure. Braking harder (not actually hard, I'm still driving it normally) lessens this issue but isn't the way an EV should ideally be driven? 
 
Brakes again - coming to a stop or initially moving away, the brakes groan a bit as the pads go on or off fully. iirc my ex-wife's two older scenics were similar and it was basically down to the caliper carriers flexing as they weren't as stiff as they could be. It's not a functional problem but it sounds like I'm driving an old banger. 
 
More minor irritations; 
The radio - sometimes it just stops receiving a signal or at least stops making a sound, from a couple of minutes up to half an hour I think the longest one was. Intermittent. Can happen on a 5 minute journey to my girlfriend's or an hour into a journey or be fine for a week. It makes other sounds still, sat nav etc and can play from bluetooth still. 
 
Door lock buttons stop working - intermittent, I normally lock and unlock via the buttons as my keys are in my pocket. Sometimes this just doesn't work. Either locking or unlocking. 
 
Public charging speed unreliable - less of an issue now I have a home charger but I bought the car just before lockdown and which delayed my house move so I ended up having to use the public charging infrastructure. So I charged and shopped as best I could. But I could start the car charging at 22kW, go to the shop, come out and it had dropped down to 3kW or anywhere in between. Other times it'll start low on a 22/43kW charger but if you disconnect and reconnect to the same charger it'll charge at full rate. It just seems inconsistent and it didn't matter what make of charger I plugged it into. This often left me sitting in my car waiting to get enough charge because it had dropped to a crawl after I'd left it. 
 
Tailgate rattle? - sounds like the tailgate or lock is rattling, knocking when driving around. Can't replicate it when stationary so it could be something else. 
 
Super soft paint - seems softer than any other I've come across before, pretty sure you can scratch it with a fingernail. I was going to get it paint sealed straight after buying it but then the world turned upside down and in the meantime I'm not entirely sure I'm wanting to keep it. 
 
 
Sorry if it sounds all grumble grumble for my first post here, there are plenty of positives with the car that I love - it's easy to drive, plenty nippy enough around town and acceptable on the motorway. I thought the hard plastic dash would be the thing that would most bother me but it's a non-issue, range is great, it's obviously super cheap to run. 
 
I don't know if the above are normal Zoe ""quirks"", things that can or can't be resolved. If I could even get a couple of the major ones then the minor ones probably wouldn't bother me but at the moment I just don't know if I want to keep it and it's been that way since the first couple of weeks of ownership. I've never spent more than £7k on a car previous and have loved my last few non-company cars, but having upped the budget when moving to a smaller house to be able to afford an EV, I'm quite disappointed. Not with the EV experience, I'm unlikely to go back, but with the traditional parts of the car really.",2020,9,18
"On ride - this is subjective. It's better over rough road and speed bumps than my 57 plate Honda civic. 
 
On brakes as slowing, yes. I rear ended a car as distracted while slowing in second week of ownership. No damage to Zoe. Slight stress mark on other car's bumper, which became expensive as it was a custom pain job mercedes... 
 
On brake groaning when pull away I suspect this is the hill start assist. They release as you accelerate rather than when you take foot off brake, but that transition will provide done tension between systems. 
 
Door buttons won't work if you use key fob to lock car as this disables the proximity system. Could this be the cause? If so, it's intentional. 
 
Yes to soft paint - I have scratched it with my finger nail when trying to remove a fleck of tar. I have authorisation to get one but touched up under Warranty currently ( haven't taken it in due Covid).",2020,9,18
"Groaning rear brakes is a feature.   
 
The brake/regen surge feeling is worst at high states of charge so I used to avoid charging to 100%. 
 
The Zoe is the cheapest EV and it does show in places. It's worth messing with tyre pressures a bit to see if you can make it a bit better. Couple of psi up or down off book pressure might make all the difference. 
 
Have you downloaded the Rlink toolkit thing? A few of the quirks get ironed out with periodic updates. If the unit wasn't reset to factory before you got it it's worth doing that and starting fresh as that can sometimes make all the difference to weird behaviour.",2020,9,18
Looks like you might have to sell it! ,2020,9,18
"Hi Zantium, 
We've had two Zoe's, the current one is the 40kWh R110 so similar to yours. I have found the ride quality and handling 'interesting' in both cars and in my view is what lets down what is generally, a very good car. What I do find is that when I go to the recycling centre with bags of rubble in the boot, it really is a good mini-van with the rear seatback removed, then the car and ride are much, much better. This all implies the rear end is the problem. 
After I realised that I then played around with tyre pressures and now have something which is OK. Unfortunately, we have the Michelin EVs so we will have the tyres going hard in winter, edges rubbing off and the generally cracking so we will be getting pair of CrossClimate+ tyres fitted this winter and will see how that goes. 
We've also had problems with the radio and the sat nav doing all sorts of things including the rebooting every few minutes but that is generally fixed by pulling fuses F26 or F31 depending on the problem. 
 
One thought on the brakes - are they corroded due to low use at the mo and need a good clean off? I have only rarely, over five years of ownership, had a problem with the transition from regen to friction but we are in a hilly area and hence the friction brakes do get used. 
 
Finally, is there anyone near you with a Zoe that you can go out in and see if it is any different?",2020,9,18
"I agree with the OP, I have had a ZE50 from ONTO for a month and dont like it at all for all the same reasons. The whole auto hold/B-mode/brake setup seems to have been thought up on a whim and had no tuning and yes it does seem to want to run into the back of things. The brakes always groan. I cant understand why when you first switch the car on it doesn't move until the accelerator is presed but every subsequent time it stops you have to hold it on the brakes. The icing on the cake is that mine won't charge on the (free) chargers I have at work work despite them working every time for any Leaf,Tesla and NV200.",2020,9,18
"Every car has likes and dislikes, I can't wait to give my Zoe ZE50 back asap. Hate the handling, seats and auto hold as so jerky. The performance is good enough and the range of course is very good.",2020,9,18
"@cah197  Yes it has auto hold except it doesn't come on straight away, which is dangerous as it requires a check each time to make sure that it has actually applied and it jerks when you set off rather than releasing smoothly. Auto hold should hold automatically and imediately as the name suggests, and relaease smoothly as soon as the accelerator is presed. The brakes groan on every release first thing in the morning and every time thereafter. With an electic car you shoudl be able to move off smoothly but the Zoe sems designed to stop this happening.",2020,9,18
I suspect that if I gave the car an Italian tune up (half an hour of really heavy footed driving) quite a few of these brake issues would solve themselves but I have lost patience with it and have arranged for it to go back to ONTO at the end of the month. There are too many features that nearly work. I drove it whilst wearing boots today and twice had it creep forward after hold had engaged only to realise that the slightest brush on the accelrator and off it goes. I think the auto hold was designed to work with the AEB and what you have now is half the system and its positively dangerous.,2020,9,19
"Well, it's been eye opening posting this thread! I assumed as none of these things came up in any reviews, even the long term ones, then I had an unusual experience compared to others but it seems not. 
 
I'm really not sure what to do now. 🤷‍♂️   I've already tried different tyre pressures previously with the ride/handling and will check the software shortly (but it looks up to date as of January 2020). 
Maybe I need to go test drive some others again, I did drive an i3 and an e-golf at dealers but found the experience frustrating as every time I arranged to test drive something I'd get there and the battery would be almost flat. Happened 4 times at different dealers. 
 
I really just want a small electric car that's fun to drive and own, if I wasn't going electric it'd probably be a Fiat 500 Abarth or even a twin air. Maybe the new Mini is the closest but I can't justify that sort of money as I work from home anyway so it's not like I'm saving heaps in the running costs.",2020,9,19
If you want a small EV that is fun to drive then try the e208 or Corsa. I can vouch for the latter being more fun than the Zoe as I had a ze40 for a year or so.,2020,9,19
No idea what you were paying for the Zoe but the top level corsa is under £300 pcm on lease from drive electric.,2020,9,19
"I actually quite like those, but as an only car I do actually need it to be able to go on longer trips now and then. I’ll have another look as I can’t remember what range they have, though I know the battery is small.  
I think I need to maybe drive an up! Or one of its sister cars too.",2020,9,20
"The software was up to date. I think the next stage is to see if I can find anything I might like more within a reasonable budget, including a bit of an increase as no battery lease. 
Bit of a look round shows there’s still very limited choice in that respect, the e-up!, mii electric and citigo are all sold out new so I can’t even test drive one.  
That sort of leaves a 33kwh e-golf or the 94ah i3 with only-car range, neither of which really impressed when I drove them but both had near flat batteries and dealers that messed me around so perhaps didn’t get the best chance.",2020,9,21
"I'm not sure the 40 could ever be classed as a 30k car. Our battery owned will have cost us about £19.5k on a 3 yr PCP if we keep it. 
 
After 2 years I've got used to the brakes. Drive it harder so you use the physical brakes more! Or knock it into neutral before the bottom of the hill...

"So it looks like we're about to become a one car household - with just the Leaf 30. 
 
My girlfriend's car - a 2005 Skoda Octavia 1.9 diesel estate - has served us well on the very long trips we sometimes take. But a few weeks ago the engine management light came on - the EGR valve is knackered. 
 
That'll be £220 fitted. 
 
Not a huge amount to be fair, but the garage doing the work have also pointed out that the inlet manifold is about 25% the diameter it should be - I've been using it for work, now a 9 mile round trip - and it's properly gunked up because it rarely gets up to full temp. So once it's fixed, it'll be put up for sale. 
 
I think, in a decade or so, motorists will look back at the age of the diesel and wonder what the F we were thinking. DPFs, DMFs, EGRs, AdBlue systems; all this accessory crap that costs a small fortune to replace, just to hide the fact that diesels stink. 
 
Here's a pic for reference (not her car!)",2019,2,20

"You could have got it cleaned for a lot less. 
Same with DPFs. 
Your car probably doesn't even have a DPF, 2005 1.9tdi cars don't. 
I do get what you're saying about ICE cars being more complex, but the fact is these costs only usually come into play at very high mileage and only contribute a tiny amount in terms of pence per mile. 
And, at some point, your ICE car will need a new battery pack at how many thousands...? 
Just saying, it's not as if EVs will just run and run forever with no major expense. 
A VERY major expense will come into play at some point. 
Meanwhile, the ICE goes on for hundreds of thousands of miles with only peripheral items needing replaced, rare for a whole engine to need done.",2019,2,20
"I'm pretty sure Euro 6 diesels came in around 2015. My 2013 dirty diesel Skoda Octavia is Euro 5 and will be subjected to London ULEZ. 
 
There's also the timing belt and water pump needs replacing at £500 a pop. My dirty diesel had just had DSG oil changed, this lasts 40k, timing belt is due end of 2022. I hope to switch to full EV household by 2022, I'll distribute my car mileage so that the diesel will not due major works before 2022. It has done 83k so far, I'm confident it can do 37k in the next 3.5 years, trouble free. 2019 will be ""just add fuel"" year thanks to 2yr/18k long life engine oil. Only a ~£250 major service planned expense in 2020 before selling it off in 2022.

Would you pay £500 to extend the warranty on your battery pack by another 6 years? 
 
I'd call it a false economy to believe that is an expense worth avoiding. 
 
If you can manage with 1 car then just park this diesel up and use it only when you really need it. I can offer you my carefully honed and developed engineering knowledge to let you into a little secret .... it won't coke up unless you use it! 
 
We have a 2001 Grand Espace which is the most practical car, shorter than 4.8m, a person can possibly own. It's timing belt has age-expired but on the basis of low mileage I am not going to throw money at that. 
 
WBAC value it at £85. Probably about the same as your Skoda. Why bother wasting time trying to sell it when it serves a purpose just parked there?",2019,2,20
"Our last diesel at 6 years old and 64k miles had had the engine overrun, the turbo go, the DPF blocked and the clutch fail twice before we sold it and changed to the leaf.

"Look up walnut blasting in your area. That and some dpf cleaner should clear it all out pretty well. As for the EGR - sometimes they go but a lot of the time they just get stuck. It's not a massive expense to just replace it anyway and if it's been stuck for a while it may well need replacing anyway.  
 
I also agree with Donald - stick it up the corner and winterise it so it's there when you want it. You can always day insure it if you only need it a few times per year though that can be expensive if you use it more often. You can tax it by the month too so when it's needed spend 10 mins on the net insuring and taxing it then when you're done simply cancel the tax and you get a refund minus any months you're part into.  
It's cheaper than hiring a car and it's always there when you like with minimal messing - just save the insurance and tax web pages in a folder in your phone.

Hi... can anyone advise please... my wife loves the 500 .. we've had 3 and now are thinking to go electric... test driven 2 at 2 showrooms ... the only thing that's stopping us ordering is a possible issue with the brakes... on both demonstrater cars when at really low speed.. as if in traffic and creeping forward.. the brakes make a horrendous squeaking sound... it happened on both demo cars... the sales guys both said it had never been heard before and FIAT have no reported issues with this problem... but when I researched it online there were a few review websites who mentioned this issue a while back... the main one being a carwow review by Mat Watson... can anyone who had bought a new 500e in the last 6 months please confirm or deny if they've had any such noise on their electric 500e ? It's the only thing that's stopping us ordering one... but if those demo cards were mine and I sat in traffic day after day with that squeaking every time ..I would go mad... thanks for any help,2022,8,4

"I've noticed with my Ioniq if I leave it parked up for a few days unused, particularly if it was raining the last time I drove it.

Maybe arrange another test drive and deliberately overuse the brakes to see if the squeak reduces or even disappears. Demo cars may not be used very often so the disk surfaces have time to oxidise a bit.",2022,8,5

"We've had our 500e since last November and have now covered ~4000 miles. 
 
Most braking is via regen, so the brakes on the wheels are not applied, however when they are used (ie by pressing the brake pedal) no squeaking. 
 
It is good practice with EV's to apply the brakes every week or two to remove any rust build up on the disks. I do this fairly gently, but at speed - 50mph - having first checked there is no-one behind me of course!",2022,8,16
"Our Zoe makes a strange Squeak coming off the brakes rather than applying them, I'm guessing its something to do with the Regen. I can only hear it with the windows down and the radio off so not too bothered about it, same as the weird harmonics I get at 60mph, I got used to it and don't notice it as much. 
 
However EV's are more susceptible to strange sounds which are normally masked on ICE vehicles so it is a problem, but if you turn the stereo up most of them go away ",2022,8,16

Yes, less in winter at high speed but that isn't my normal driving. 
Another point to bear in mind is that today's EVs are at the evolutionary stage my 100E was when new. But nothing could beat its best time between Chigwell and Bromley (20 miles in 20 minutes though the Blackwall Tunnel circa 1970. You'd be pushed to do it in under an hour today!)",2016,8,14

Hi there, I have a 500e icon on lease and it was all going good untill a month ago I kept getting a onscreen warning saying something is wrong with the passenger airbag and the SOS assistance. 
 
I called fiat and they said take it to my local dealer but I didn't have time as it's 16 mile away and I go to work. But then as of a couple of week ago I was sometimes getting a seatbelt warning symbol and sound and it seemed to only happen when I was turning left lol....I tried to pull on the seatbelt in different directions and where it clips in to recreate the warning but it never happene donly when I drive and turn left. 
 
And now I keep getting all those warning but no it says one pedal driving unavailable and to use the normal break...and yep in range and Sherpa when this wanting happens I take foot of accelerator and the car keeps going...no refen breaking 
 
Just drove from work tonight and I had to drive 5 mile with all these warnings going off. I stopped my car twice turned it off but still happened. 
 
I've had the car since may I think it is...end of April start of may. 
 
And to top all that off last week lifting my boot lid I heard something rolling around inside my boot door/lid...where inside the boot you have that odd plastic that's coated in material covering the boot lid/door internals it sounds like sometjings come off inside there and rolling around when I'm driving or opening the boot.

All that for a few journeys a yr that are further than BEV range which is rapidly becoming 200mls, and anti range anxiety. Its not the cars that need to get better as much as the drivers. I despair when i see drivers screaming up to red lights and then braking hard,not helped by cars that are too heavy and small engines providing little braking. This effect is only made worse in town EVs by adding all the extra weight. 
 
In my book the correct EV is one that does 90% of your journeys without even thinking about range anxiety. Does 5% where you need to drive with consideration/sympathy and 5% it cannot do without plan B.

"What I find fascinating is that all car manufacturers are observing the same factors that are forcing them to look at the EV world more, and reaching totally different conclusions on how to react.

Honda are a classic example of that. Hydrogen is clearly a mistake but they misread the political desire to back it as they understood that it could be taxed easier and that it would be a politically sound way to go. Unfortunately, they failed to also understand that politicians are clueless and will change tack as often as their underpants. Honda have a lot of ground to make up and risk losing credibility if they do make the necessary U turn.

They deliberately make a car that is useless but satisfies the rules and then make every effort not to sell it so that they can claim no demand. Nissan seems to be in a bit of a conflict too. They have a tiger by the tail with the Leaf. But rather than build on it by leapfrogging the competition that is already announced, and maintaining their lead, the indication is that the new car will not even match the others. Not content with that they have built a car propelled entirely by petrol but using an EV final drive. Meanwhile all their existing customers have been baffled as to why they didn't build a Qashquai EV to decimate the Outlander. 
 
The whole future of EVs is still in the melting pot and it would appear that every manufacturer is still unsure on which way to push. To go full BEV, Rex, or ENote style - that is the question.",2017,6,16
"Whoever gets an EV to the market in the Qashquai sized sector at a reasonable price (£30k max), with a decent boot (425L min) and a decent range (250) will have a waiting list longer than a very long thing, and I'd be on it. The Hyundai Kona looked promising but it's a Juke rival, so too small. Model Y is likely to be too pricey.",2017,6,16
"The ""real world experience of economy"" between an eNote and a Prius may come down to who is driving the car and what type of roads they are used on.

"Tesla Model 3 design is “pretty much final,” plus new insights from a batch of high quality photos

 TESLA MODEL 3 
  
Another day, another batch of Model 3 photos, and more new insights about the car’s design. This time the photos come from multiple posts on reddit by You You Xue,  u/youyouxue , who spotted the Model 3 at the San Mateo supercharger and got several high quality photos which we’ll have a look at below. 
 
 Xue said he spoke to the employee who was driving the car, and that the employee stated that the car is pretty much the final design before the first delivery (*not a direct quote from the employee, but Xue’s summary of the conversation). One thing to note is that the cockpit and steering wheel looks the same as it did in  the other recent batch of photos  we saw of them, so if this is pretty much the final design, then it’s likely that we’ll end up with a rather conventional steering wheel design on the finalized vehicle. It’s still possible that it might change, but looking less likely as we get closer and closer to release. Today’s photo of the steering wheel and interior does look the same as those other recent photos, so if Tesla is still keeping any secrets, they must be keeping them rather close to their chest.",2017,6,22

"Volvo to launch Tesla-rivalling Polestar sub-brand 
 
Volvo's performance sub-brand is taking on Tesla and BMW's i with its own range of bespoke electric models 
 
 
WORDS BYDarren Moss 'What Car' 
 
 
 
 21 Jun 2017 11:02 Last updated: 21 Jun 2017 11:21 
 
 
Volvo’s performance sub-brand, Polestar, will produce its own range of sporty electric vehicles, with the first model likely to be revealed later this year at the Frankfurt motor show. 
 
Electric cars made by Polestar won’t carry a Volvo logo, much in the same way that Fiat’s performance arm, Abarth, doesn’t put a Fiat badge onto its cars. However, while Abarth tunes existing Fiat products – such as the  500 hatchback  and  124 Spider  convertible – Polestar will be producing its own, bespoke vehicles. 
 
Polestar’s cars will use the same underpinnings as Volvo models – bosses have previously hinted that the first Polestars could be based on the  S90 ,  V90 ,  XC90  and  XC60  – but they’ll look substantially different inside and out, feel different to drive, and are likely to carry bigger price tags. 
 
Indeed, Polestar officials have told What Car? that this is the company “raising its head for the first time” as a bespoke car maker. 
 
 
 
Polestar’s entry into the electric car market will put it into competition with established performance-oriented electric brands such as BMW i and  Tesla . 
 
The brand’s focus on producing high-performance electric vehicles means it’s unlikely to compete with mass-market options including the  Renault Zoe  and  Nissan Leaf , but will instead focus on rivals including the  BMW i8 ,  Tesla Model S  and  Model X .",2017,6,22

"GM’s Chevy Bolt EV sales increase to new high of 1,642 units 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 3rd 2017 10:55 am ET 
 
 CHEVY BOLT EV   GM 
  
 
Albeit slowly, GM’s Chevy Bolt EV sales are still growing – reaching a new high of 1,642 units in the US last month. 
 
It brings the total delivered of the new all-electric vehicle in the US to 7,592 units since the beginning of the year and just over 8,000 since its launch in December 2016. 
 
In June,  GM opened Chevy Bolt EV orders for approved dealerships nationwide,  But that didn’t contribute to deliveries since the first shipment to the new approved dealerships are expected in August. 
 
At that point, we should have a better idea of the market for the Bolt EV. 
 
In the meantime, it’s still not clear if the vehicle is still production constraint or if it’s a demand issue. In certain markets where the vehicle is officially available, it can be difficult to get your hands on one, while in other markets, like California, there are decent inventories and some  customers have been getting away with paying $25,000 after incentives  due to discounts. You can always check with  your local dealers for inventory  and see if you can find a deal. 
 
The Chevy Bolt EV has an MSRP of $37,500 before any incentive. 
 
A few vehicles have also been shipped to Canada and to Opel in Europe, but the bulk of its market is still the US, where sales have been growing slowly month to month over the last quarter:",2017,7,3

"VW unveils all-electric research car with 250 miles of range and mobile charging robots 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 5:10 am ET  
 
  
 
Volkswagen’s research group displayed some of the new and cutting edge technologies that it has been working on recently – including some related to electric vehicles. 
 
They unveiled their all-electric research car, which is capable of over 250 miles of range, a first for VW’s EVs, and new mobile charging robots are presented as a possible charging solution for the vehicle. 
 
 The Golf-based vehicle serves as a test bed for VW’s upcoming electric vehicle programs, like I.D. concepts: 
 
“This provides an insight into the next generation of automobiles for efficient long-distance mobility with a range of more than 400 kilometres. The lightweight architecture has been designed for maximum crash safety including the battery. The battery is based on advanced lithium-ion cells and the efficiency of the electric motor has been optimised.” 
 
Volkswagen is also using the platform to test technologies related to electric vehicles. 
 
The most interesting is undoubtedly a “mobile robot charger.” They released a few pictures of the system: 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Despite the fact that the actual act of plugging an electric vehicle is no more cumbersome, actually arguably less, than refueling a gas-powered car, there seems to be some sort of obsession to try to automate it. 
 
There have been several different concepts, but VW’s mobile robot charger is certainly novel. The company sees some advantages for underground garages and multi-story car parks: 
 
“In future, rapid charging of the electric vehicle will be extremely convenient. Mobile robots will connect up the automobile for recharging. Group Research is therefore working on charging robot concepts for underground garages and multi-story car parks. The Gen.E research vehicle is charged by the robot.”",2017,7,4

"Electric cars reach record 42% of Norway’s total new car sales with boost from Tesla Model X 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 7:34 am ET  
 
 
 TESLA MODEL X   NORWAY 
  
While most countries have difficulties making electric cars reach 2% or 3% of their total car sales, Norway keeps pushing the bar higher and higher. 
 
Last month was another record month for the country with electric cars representing 42% of its new vehicles being registered.  
 
 That’s a significant jump from their last record in January when they reached 37% of new car sales . 
 
The country’s EV incentives, like the 25% VAT tax exemption, are helping maintain the rate of adoption about 10 times higher than most markets. 
 
In June, all-electric vehicles also reached a record 27% of new car sales with plug-in hybrids making up the difference. 
 
The record was helped by a big boost in Tesla Model X deliveries which had a record month in Norway with 609 registrations in June – enough to make it the second most popular vehicle in the country. The Model X contributed only 238 units to the last record. 
 
It was only surpassed by 874 VW e-Golfs, which remains very popular in Norway, like its gas-powered version, according to  new vehicle registrations  (Norwegian). 
 
Renault’s Zoe, which has been  dominating electric vehicle sales in several European markets , also had a good month contributing 428 vehicles to the new record. 
 
Finally, the first shipment of the Opel Ampera E, the European version of the Chevy Bolt EV, helped by adding 389 all-electric vehicles to the total, which may have resulted in an artificial increase of EVs for the month and created the record since G M is not expected to dedicate more of its Bolt production to Opel until next year.  
 
Nonetheless, Norway is really close to the tipping point of electric cars where they become the majority of car sales in the country, which has the goal to reach 100% of new car sales being zero-emission vehicles starting in 2025. 
 
With several new models coming to market in Norway next year, like Tesla Model 3, Audi e-tron quattro, and hopefully, the Opel Ampera E in higher volume, this new record of 42% of car sales could quickly seem low and the 2025 goal, which is among the most aggressive of any country, is starting to look attainable.",2017,7,4
VW had better make that a 5 door though or many won't buy it purely on those grounds. Have you ever tried getting out of a car with such huge doors in narrow parking spaces. Unless they plan a gull/swan/albatross door that is. In which case even more wouldn't buy it.,2017,7,4
"Tesla obtains design patents on Model 3 wheels 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 4th 2017 2:17 pm ET  
 
 
  
 
When first unveiling the Tesla Model 3 in March 2016, the prototypes came equipped with new wheels designed by the automaker. 
 
CEO Elon Musk said that  they “spent a lot of time on those” and that they plan on bringing them to production . Though a lot of things have changed since and Tesla plans to limit the options available on the Model 3 – at least at the beginning. 
 
 
 
Musk confirmed last month that  wheel size is probably one of the only options that early Model 3 buyers will be able to choose – that and the color. 
 
But he didn’t say anything about the options for the designs of the wheels, which is not always the same thing as wheel size. 
 
Now we learn Tesla has obtained design patents on 3 of the Model 3 wheel designs that were previously unveiled. While it doesn’t mean they will release those wheels, it means they are securing the rights to them. 
 
Tesla applied for the patents on March 30, as they were about to unveil the Model 3, and the design patents were released over the last month. 
 
Franz Von Holzhausen, Tesla’s Chief Designer, is credited for the design of each wheel, but longtime Tesla designer David Imai and Bernard Lee are also credited for the first Model 3 wheel design – United States Patent USD789860: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
That’s the wheel designed that has been the most commonly spotted on Model 3 release candidates in the wild. 
 
The second wheel design is an aero wheel option to improve the vehicle’s aerodynamic performance – United States Patent USD788672 : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Von Holzhausen and Lee are the designers credited for the design of this wheel. 
 
While not as popular as the first wheel, it was also  spotted on several Model 3 release candidates . 
 
As for the last wheel for which Tesla obtained a design patent last month, it was unveiled at the March 2016 event, but it was never spotted on any release candidate since – United States Patent USD788671: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
It was actually only seen on plastic model of the Model 3 and not on a working prototype like the two other vehicles. 
 
Joonas Vartola, a car designer who doesn’t work for Tesla anymore, is credited for the design of this one. 
 
If the release candidates are a good indicator of the options available for the Model 3, it looks this last one is not going to be available. 
 
We should have a better idea of the wheel options for the Model 3 once Tesla starts opening the online design studio, which is expected to happen on or around the 28th when Tesla will deliver the first few vehicles.",2017,7,4
"Fig 1 - OK

"Daimler announces new $740 million battery factory in China for Mercedes-Benz’s EVs 
 Fred Lambert   
 
- Jul. 5th 2017 9:35 am ET  
 
 
  
 
Just a few weeks after unveiling  its own new battery Gigafactory for electric vehicles  in Germany, Daimler is now announcing a new $740 million battery factory project in China. 
 
The new factory will support the production of batteries for electric vehicles under the Mercedes-Benz brand. 
 
 It’s the first major project as part of Daimler’s new  investments in electric vehicles through its joint-venture with BAIC in China.  
 
Markus Schäfer, Member of the Divisional Board of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Production and Supply Chain, commented on the announcement: 
 
“Building another premium eBattery factory is the next step in the implementation of our electric strategy. Thus, we have the first foreign location in our global battery production network. The local production of batteries is crucial in order to meet the demand for electric vehicles flexibly and efficiently,” 
 
While Daimler is making significant investments in battery production, they are still not producing battery cells. Like the one in Germany, the new factory will produce battery modules and packs, but they will be sourcing the cells from elsewhere. 
 
The German automaker wouldn’t confirm from which supplier, but they did say that the cells will be sourced from China. 
 
Berenberg Bank analyst  Alexander Haissl recently expressed doubts about the sourcing strategy of traditional automakers : 
 
“Clear visibility about high-volume cell-sourcing strategies continue to elude traditional manufacturers, although we expect announcements for large facilities to eventually emerge to resolve the key issue of battery supply constraints,” 
 
Daimler will be able to choose from several different battery cell manufacturers to supply its new factory. Several companies, like  Panasonic  and CATL , have been building battery cells factories in China. 
 
Hubertus Troska, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Greater China, also commented on the announcement: 
 
“We are investing in the world’s largest market for Battery Electric Vehicles, By 2025, the Chinese market will have a substantial share in sales of Mercedes-Benz electric vehicles. Therefore, local production will be key to the success of our EV portfolio, and crucial to flexibly serving local demand for electric vehicles.” 
 
They expect production at the new facility to start in 2020. 
 
The news comes just as  Tesla confirmed working with the Shanghai Government to establish its own manufacturing facility in the region.  
 
A clear rush to invest in electric vehicles is happening in China. Tesla wants to tap into what is now the world’s biggest auto market and legacy automakers are speeding up their plans to match the country’s ZEV mandate. Automakers need zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to represent 8% of new car sales as soon as 2018 and quickly ramp up to 12% by 2020.",2017,7,5
"Two points on this thread drift to autonomous cars.

"Hi All, 
 
I picked up my i3 from EVEZY last week and thought we could all do with a place to share experiences and answer any questions people may have about the process. 
 
First some background 
 
EVEZY are a short term electric car lease company with a unique business model. 
 
1) You rent the car month by month, no deposit and no minimum term (well a month minimum technically but you pay in advance) 
2) Rental includes insurance (£1000 excess though in fault claims) up to 1000 miles. month, tax and all maintenance costs 
3) you do not get a key, you use an app to lock and unlock the car. 
4) You can pick cars up and drop them off and ""depots"" around the country. 
 
You can use a referral code (see below   ) to get £50 off your first month. 
 
My experiences so far.  
 
I phoned on Wednesday and asked for a 120 i3. No problems at all; arranged pickup the next day from Windsor 
 
Took the train to Windsor only to realise it is a 4 mile trip to the pickup point, I stupidly decided to walk. The pickup point is not obvious and is actually someone's house (the cars are all parked in a big yard) There were at least 3 i3s and a few Zoes there as well. 
 
Once I find the car (the reg is on the app) it connect to the app via bluetooth and a button unlocks the car. The car was brand new and still had the plastic seat covers on so I was pleasantly surprised (note there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.) 
 
The only hitch was that the 3 pin cable to charge the car is in the front boot and the button on the app did not seem to work. I phoned them and it is a known problem that they are working on (hint to EVEZY, if this is an issue don't put the charging cable in the boot!) Fortunately I RTFM and found the emergency release wire in the cabin so used that to open and move the cable into the back boot. 
 
Car is great, there is a dash-cam but you soon forget about that, otherwise it is just like a normal i3. When I got home I was able to activate the BMW connected app and set preconditioning times etc so that all works like a normal car.  
 
Overall I am very impressed, the lease is cheaper than most other places and far more flexible, it also includes insurance so that is another saving. My only concern is the app but it is working fine so far. I have only had to enter the password once but do now carry my reading glasses everywhere I go! 
 
My referral code is in my sig. I know others have codes as well so feel free to contribute and people can pick a code at random! 
 
Please feel free to ask any more questions if you have them.",2019,3,5
Done 👍,2020,4,21
Also done. Thought it important you got a boomer’s point of view ,2020,4,21
"Following my suggestion, evezy have have agreed to rollover mileage until July. That way, any mileage credit you accumulate during lockdown will be rolled over. Hopefully if lockdown finishes by the end of May, we’ll have June and July to hit the open road without having to pay overage charges if we do more than 1k miles. (As long as we don’t go over that months allocation and rolled over miles from March onwards).",2020,4,21
"And those 8ppm refunds for unused miles...? 
 
... oh. 😂",2020,4,21
"Just sent off my return notice to Evezy, done 100 miles in the i3 last month, not the best use of £400. I have ordered a £290pm 15k 1+23 PCH on new Zoe GT line so a lot cheaper than evezy on all counts",2020,4,22

Dropping the car off wasn’t as straightforward as I’d hoped. I got to the NCP in Bristol and tried to use the QR code provided over email.. and “Evezy FULL” is all it would say on the display. Luckily with lockdown there was no one waiting behind me at the barriers. Eventually had to get a ticket and hope that I don’t get charged for it. 
 
Anyway, that’s my Evezy journey over for now. It’s been a blast, and apart from two occasions early on where their services went down it’s been 100% solid. A great service really.",2020,4,22
"Just to clarify I can afford it just fine, it’s the principle 😂",2020,4,22
"They will try their absolute best to pretend it doesn’t. 
 
It’s a sticky wicket though. How would they handle it? 
 
It makes sense to charge the money owed from the freeze period once the customer hands the car back, but 1) they could be waiting a while and 2) a lump sum payment won’t go down well with customers. 
 
Do they increase the monthly charge after a freeze period to compensate? Possibly - but they may not ever get the money back if the customer returns the car! 
 
The only pragmatic approach, which I’ve suggested and been refused endlessly, is goodwill discounts based on unused mileage.",2020,4,25
"The intent by the government is to assist those in need and provide payment holidays for car payments so it should apply. Yes the car can be returned but may still be essential for some who are in financial difficulty and need help. 
 
The best approach as suggested is to offer discounts based on mileage for the period. Sharing the pain seems the best approach.",2020,4,26
"The payment holiday doesn't mean that the debt goes away, and the expectation is that you will still have to repay the full amount plus interest after the holiday. This applies to loan repayments. This is different to the EVEZY model where you pay for a rental service without any loan.",2020,4,26
"I think the issue is more that literally every monthly payment service in every other area is at least offering a goodwill gesture. 
 
Meanwhile, Evezy: “Something about European driving that most people don’t care about” 
 
Just doesn’t look great or inspire loyalty, y’know?",2020,4,26
"Surely the point is that the EvEzy system is designed for exactly this type of scenario - if you don't want to pay you don't have to - you just give the car back as you aren't tied in. The mortgage and PCP companies still want their money, with interest, they are just changing your profile payment and charging you extra for the privilege.",2020,4,26
"Which would be fine if they were able to supply a replacement quickly when the time comes to resubscribe, which they currently can’t do. So effectively if you want use of a car at all in the next 6 months (the time it’d take them to supply a replacement), your only real option is to keep your current car and pay for it. 
 
Hence the request for a goodwill gesture in recognition of their own supply issues. 
 
That’s all we’re asking for. A gesture to loyal customers to compensate for their current failings as a business. But currently their attitude is “lol tough shit if you don’t like it give it back”. 
 
Great, cool, good CRM guys.",2020,4,26
Evezy isn’t a finance product so the FCA guidance on car finance breaks doesn’t apply. If you want a break from payments return the car!,2020,4,26
Yawn. I tried.,2020,4,26
"I’m not quite at the point of picking up an inventory car with cash yet - as far as I’m aware, Model 3s are still a depreciating asset and I’m averse to having cash tied up in such things, but as used prices drop then stabilise I’m sure there’ll be a point where that becomes preferable or even more flexible compared to Evezy...",2020,4,26
"Aye but buying for cash means you can get rid at a moments notice, just like Evezy. Eventually there’ll be a point where the depreciation plateaus relative to the buy price and it’ll be worth doing. 
 
Previously I was hiring Model S whenever I needed a car through Enterprise Exotics, or whatever seemed interesting from the EV centre in MK, but then we moved somewhere that required more frequent car use (not necessarily more miles though) so went with Evezy for flexibility. Price wise is roughly the same per mile as the Enterprise rentals, but availability is obviously better if the car is outside your house! 
 
PCP you still have the ball ache of flogging it when no longer required, and I don’t like the “debt” showing on my credit report. I’ve never finished a PCP term - usually got rid after 3-6 months of a 4 year deal and never really lost out (sub £1k losses), but it’s just a bit of a pain to do so. 
 
Under normal circumstances, Evezy is still the best option, but it would just be nice to have my loyalty rewarded.",2020,4,26
"According to this  article  people will avoid public transport for the rest of the year and be looking to buy a new or used vehicle. Many will look to long term rental in order to remain flexible. Londoners could opt for EVs to avoid the congestion and emissions charge, and take advantage of cheap parking. Could this situation play into the hands of evezy?",2020,4,26
"@UKTechie  One Fiat 500, one Mazda MX5, one battery lease Renault Zoe and one Ioniq Hybrid. All sold during PCP after 12 months at most. 
 
 @E7EV  With respect that article is probably balls. Folk can stay at home or rent cars if they like, but I wager it’ll be a fearful minority not the majority. Most of us will be back on the tube to work first chance we get. 
 
Remember that most folk (including myself) were still commuting to work in London, on the tube, in late March as the curve was climbing and infection rates were basically exponential. Even with those high odds, I still don’t know a single friend or colleague who has reported symptoms (although being no older than early 30s probably helps!) 
 
By the time the “state” lets us outside again (almost as if we’re adults capable of evaluating risk all by ourselves), the actual danger will be far lower than it was in late March. 
 
The perception may well be different given all the fear mongering press, but most folk will see through it, look at the numbers, cover their face just to be sure and get on a train to work. 
 
Of course if it starts climbing again we’ll all re-evaluate, but probably choose “staying home” over “driving to work”.",2020,4,26

"It's really sad to see Nissan in such a state. I'd say right up until the first LEAF, they were a distinctly Japanese manufacturer leading the way in a lot of fields. I'm not even talking about the old Silvias and ""iconic"" JDM stuff - the GT-R and 370Z weren't that long ago, for example..! Since then, the Japanese-designed stuff seems to have been half-arsed (eg LEAF 2) and the rest is just ""too many cooks"" Eurotrash (Qashqai etc). 
 
I'd love to buy a Nissan circa 1980-2010. It was a mark of quality. No more, though... whether that's the fault of Ghosn or the xenophobes who ousted him that have now taken the reins, I'm not sure.",2020,5,5
"Today's random Evezy bug: 
 
My mileage allowance for this month has shown as 1000 throughout, until I preconditioned the car remotely to charge the 12v, then it showed 999. I suspect the reason for this is GPS error tolerance - I reckon the car reported a slightly different GPS position when it switched on to precondition than it had when it was parked, and the black box therefore thought the car had moved. Perhaps only by 0.05 miles or something, but the Evezy app rounds down anyway so this was enough to cause it to display 999. 
 
They're looking into it anyway. Personally if I was them I'd increase the GPS tolerance to not count movement below 0.5mi or something.

"Hi All, 
 
New here, but thought I would share my experience so far of buying a used Leaf. 
 
My wife had a Fiat 500, which was becoming far too small for her and our 2 year old son, she asked if we could change it to something bigger, my immediate thought was a Leaf, I have wanted one since they were announced in the UK, however the cost of them have been quite prohibitive, but thought as there are a few used ones available, now is the time to look, so that resulted in a trip to my local Nissan dealer to see what they had in stock. 
 
I fell in love with it as soon as I took it out (note the 'I') however my wife wasn't interested in the slightest, she wanted a Corsa (huge in comparison to the 500 Convertible) so, we got her one. I then decided I wanted one so much I sold my 2 year old Zafira Tourer to get one. While this was happening the dealer sold the one I was looking at, so by the time I was ready for one two weeks later, they did a group stock search and found me one that matched my criteria exactly - Max of upto 3 years old, White, and maximum of 15k on the clock, it had done 12,000 miles. It was however at another location within the group so I put a deposit down on the 28th of Feb to get the car over to me. That process took 10 days to move the car 40 miles, which surprised me to be honest as if I thought it was actually going to take that long I would have gone to the garage it was at and looked at it there, but they did say it could take that long. 
 
As soon as the car arrived I was like a kid the night before Christmas, so excited. I shot down to the dealer to take it out for a drive. When I got there the car's bodywork was spotless, which made me very happy, however, the dealer pointed out before getting into the car it was missing it's SD Card, now as I have spent some time lurking in the background here, I know it's more than just maps stored on there and how useless the Centre Console is without it. But they promised me they could get me one in within 10 Days, so thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt and trust them. There was another issue with the steering wheel, as in it would rattle over small bumps, but they said that would be fixed. 
 
Well, lets say it will be 3 weeks on Friday since this was pointed out, I am still waiting, I resorted to contacting Nissan UK's MD office to find out what the hell is going on, the part has a 6 week lead time, not 10 days as the dealer was quoting (they were told 10 days by Nissan) So I am still without a car that I can use the basic functions on such as set the clock, listen to the radio, set charge schedules etc. 
 
There is still no sign of the card, and no time frame as to when to expect it, the steering problem has returned, the drivers seat has developed a nasty squeak on the backrest. All of the rattles and squeaks are only made worse as I cant drown them out with the radio! 
 
Nissan have agreed to lend me a demo car until the dealer can come to a resolution to the matter, the last time I heard from them was Friday, I have told them I want an exchange vehicle under the Nissan Cared for promise. 
 
I am sick of the fact that no one is giving me a date for anything! I have had a car that hasn't had any of it's advertised features for over 2 weeks now, which is not acceptable, especially as it was promised within 10 days, and that was part of the conditions of sale, I said to the salesman I would wait if he could say it would be within 10 days.  
 
My plan now is to return the car as I am not happy with it, I am not happy with the service I have had, and it sure as hell isn't as advertised.

Does anyones GTE experience a slight juddering when in electric mode? This happens to mine when sat in traffic and slowly pulling away the car judders. I have it booked in to be looked at by VW in a couple of weeks but wasn't sure if this was normal.,2015,10,14
"Drat. It seems I've joined the club... 
 
Few days ago I started to feel a judder when at low speeds/pulling away. Only noticed it when on electric, it kind of feels like trying to pull away in an ICE in too high a gear, although the display says it's in 1st. This happens whether I'm using ACC or manually accelerating. Like others, it goes away above around 5 mph. I'll give it a couple of weeks to see whether it's temporary, otherwise it'll be a trip to the dealer :-(.  
 
This is my first time with an automatic gearbox, but I've also noticed sluggishness in a few situations. For example with a typical manual ICE, I could stick it in reverse to pull out of a parking space, bung it in 1st when still rolling backwards, and away we go forwards. In the GTE I've nearly crashed while attempting similar manoeuvres. While gently rolling backwards in reverse I moved the stick to D and hit the go pedal - nothing happens. I probably went another 4-5 feet backwards before the car finally got the message. This also happens if gently moving forwards, putting it in reverse & hitting Go. There's a noticeable lag in response. Anyone else experienced this? Wondering if it could be connected to an issue with the gearbox, or whether it's my inexperience of an automatic! 
 
Cheers",2018,7,6
"Thankfully I don't have the dreaded judder. However this is my first automatic too and it has been my lifelong habit to select first gear while rolling backwards and use the clutch to stop the car and drive off forwards in one slick movement. 
 
I have given that up. It dawned on me that the maneuver depended heavily on clutch control and you have lost that in an automatic. It feels like mechanical abuse now so I stopped doing it.",2018,7,6
"Yep, I know what you mean! Old habits die hard... 
 
On the way home I had some stop start traffic including juddering so thought I'd do a test. Put the car in battery charge mode to fire up the ICE & the judder got noticeably worse & lasted up until about 7mph. Electric only it lasted until around 4mph.

My dealer isn't happy with that response - neither am I. They are not happy as VW's initial response was to replace the Mechatronics unit and it shouldn't have been if at that point it was expected behavior. Also, older GTE's don't do it, and if it was expected behavior then surely it would have done it in the first couple of weeks of ownership, not just starting at week 3 ? 
My case continues...",2018,8,7
"Yep, your dealer and yourself are right to be calling cobblers.  
 
Keep pushing! 
 
I know it’s of no help at all, but my 2015 model GTE has felt unburstable and it has never ever juddered.  
 
You’d hope that any franchised VW dealer know what they’re doing, but a previous car I had (a Polo GTI with DSG box) went in for a judder in first and second gear at low speeds.  
 
They diagnosed a faulty clutch pack, which was duly replaced but the DSG box was playing up even worse on the test drive.  
 
The DSG box had to be re-calibrated using a software procedure that nobody in the dealership had done before, it took them a few days to finally get it right.",2018,8,7

"For short to medium distance trips, most models are going to feel ""thirsty"" after the GTE !. 
My wife has a new basic Fiat 500 that is fine for what she requires, but it is SO under powered it is crazy !. 
But truly, I do feel we are visiting the petrol station MORE often for her car than my GTE !. 
The last time the GTE was in for service, the dealer gave me a 1.0 Litre three cylinder Polo to use for the day. 
Granted, you could buy 3 Polo's for what the GTE costs new, but after driving that car for even 1 day - I was SO glad to get my GTE back !. Honestly, it did feel like it consumed MORE petrol in that one day than my GTE would have done so over the same driven distance. Okay, I know this is because my car would have been running a lot of that time on electric power, but you do quickly become use to this method of propulsion and therefore DO spend less time visiting the petrol stations as a result !. 
I STILL think the the GTE is a pretty hard act to follow, given it has been out now for WELL over three years !. 
Strange situation really, the GTE was something that really took it's time getting started and in turn liked by the early buyers. The feed back from the motoring press was pretty positive, but the take up of the GTE was slow, but after it had been released just after a year, very quickly the demand for the car went stupid CRAZY !. 
The massive and sudden increase in it's demand, I think was part of it's demise in the end ????. 
Normal, I would have replaced my GTE at three years - but prior to reaching the car's 3rd birthday, there was nothing out there that could offer me anything more than my car had to offer at that present moment in time I.M.H.O. 
This is why I still have my car now when it is WELL over three years old ( that is a real first for me ). 
The problem I see with owning a GTE myself is simply this, returning to a full on only fossil car is NOT an option really anymore. So I guess to this level then the GTE has done a really great job, a brilliant ( toe in the water / introduction ) into the world of electric propulsion, also with the addition of a fossil fuel back up should you need it for them longer trips. 
For me anyway, a full B.E.V. has to be the next step really - but right now I feel that I am sitting in a waiting room, being caught out between the now decreasing amount of hybrid cars available and the small choice of affordable BEV's that has a range to suit my needs. 
Okay, the new Kona has just been recently been released at a price that is NOT stupid / crazy and does indeed have a very good electrical mileage range between each charge. 
Getting your hands on a 64 KW Kona is a totally different ball game I believe !!!. 
They ARE in front of other manufacture's right now with regards to bringing an E.V. to the market that is both affordable to the majority of the people, BUT can also cover a real world reasonable distance on a single charge. 
For this alone, they should be very welcomed and commended for doing so. 
The wait list is very long for the Kona I understand, but there IS more models from other manufacture's to follow in 2019 - 2020. 
It's a really strange feeling right now, I just feel like the new nervous prospective father sitting outside of the labour ward in a hospital !. 
You know something great is going to happen very soon, but the waiting is killing you and are not sure when and what the new delivery is likely to be !!!!. Ha Ha !.",2018,12,1
"agree with all of above luklily my GTE is only a year old so will be up for replacement just as the ID comes out. As for amount of fuel, we also have a 1.2 Fiat 500, it gets about 40mpg worse than driving the GTE hard in ICE only, mind you the tank is about half the size and drops from 1/4 full to empty in just a few miles so we are always filling the Fiat tank up which makes it feel worse. Had a new GTI last week for a few hours and only got 28mpg.",2018,12,2
"So, my Mk 7.5 from Oct. 2017 had the Mechatronic unit replaced twice, last in Sep 2018, and the jutter returned on Dec 28th. The dealer then tried to change the oil from one type to another, but that didn't help at all. Still juttering. 
So now the car is going back to the garage next Thursday. Unless they decide to replace the entire gear box I think I will have to return the car and get my money back, unfortunately. 
But I guess replacing the entire gearbox won't eliminate the problem either...",2019,1,16
New gearbox and mechatronic unit for me has cured the issue for me. Been driving it hard for 2 months now and no issues,2019,1,19

I do have the same issue in GTE from 2016 - got a used model in July and couldn't be more happy with it.",2019,10,6
"One year on from my Mechatronics & Gearbox replacement and the juddering has not returned. It does appear the dealer didn’t tighten the exhaust back up properly during the works as I had to take it back for that but the original fault is gone.

"The PSA Peugeot / Citroen forum is incorrectly titled and poorly organised. 
 
With your help, we'd like to fix that. 
 
Stellantis brands are Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, RAM, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. 
 
Stellantis are rapidly becoming a major BEV manufacturer. Fiat will be an EV only brand in Europe by 2026. That is full BEVs, not hybrids. 
 
 
 
I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum. That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sources:",2022,3,21
Fixed.,2022,3,21
"Group cars and vans on the same body together would be the most sensible I think. Otherwise I'd think it would get out of hand very quickly. 
 
It also highlights common vehicles with common underpinnings which quite often have the same issues. Much easier to see at a glance when a new herd of 'why does my X do this' where X is the same actual car but with a different jacket on.",2022,3,21
"Yep, group by floor pan. 
 
Bear in mind the unintended consequences of that logic; you should also regroup VAG products, and likewise HKMC. 
 
(I always thought we should, really...) 
 
It makes perfect sense because both hardware and software are common features/faults, and if the forum is aiming to be a relevant technical resource, then failing to group Audi with Skoda (say) is just badge discrimination of no meaningful benefit.",2022,3,21
"Clearly no effort has been made to group other sibling manufacturers cars together so picking on stellantis is wrong for more reasons than one might think. 
Treat these vehicles the same as everything else. 
From the perspective of what I drive this would mean having a Vauxhall forum with sub forums for Mokka and another for Corsa etc. 
Vans should be treated however they already are. 
Similar for Peugeot and Citroën 
The stellantis name shouldn't even come into it. 
 
Clearly if someone has an issue with a pug 208 and the issue might also relate to a corsa they can search appropriately. 
 
By grouping things together it makes things a lot less clear and more difficult and for no reasonable benefit. 
 
Another example is where posts that should have gone straight into the mokka forum were in random places because the poster could not locate the correct place. 
 
The issue is the amount of work to do initially but once organised correctly the only extra work to do is add a new sub forum for a new car. 
 
Of course, you might want to group opel with vauxhall but that is clearly sensible. 
 
Gaz",2022,3,21
Once the Stellantis forum is organised there is no reason not to group others similarly either. It's all been a mess for a long time.,2022,3,21
"Yeah --- 
 
I fall into the engineer group that drives the car, and couldn't care less about the badge.  
 
Before the internet, I would take things apart, including my brand new cars just to see how they were put together. Now I can google it and let someone else take the risk. 
 
The Munro live videos are influencing my upcoming car decision. I've already removed one car from the long list because I don't like the engineering decisions.",2022,3,21
Which is why I posted this survey instead of just asking the admin team to make the change.,2022,3,21
"I think grouping cars by body makes sense on a forum more devoted to DIY repairs, in depth technical analysis and stuff like that. It will likely make more sense when the cars are older as well. 
 
I think this forum, these days is more about the consumer side where people will take their cars to garages, often dealers and so it is more appropriate for the cars to be grouped by make and model.  
 
Just because the e-208 and Corsa e share fundamental components, that doesn't matter for customers discussing dealers, discounts and the like nor does it have much to do with servicing and maintenance when they are so new. Having all Vauxhall and Peugeot posts in one forum muddies those discussions considerably.  
 
I originally voted for group cars and vans by body because that makes sense to me as a nerd/more technical person but I have changed to car and vans get separate sub-forums based on responses to this thread and considering the purpose of this forum overall. Also, one big benefit of computers, we can have as many sub-fora as we want! 
 
It's interesting to consider the long term implications for this forum really, when all new cars are EVs this could be a busy place, but I guess people will split off as all the dedicated manufacturer forums will have sub-forums for the EVs. SpeakEV can remain as a manufacturer agnostic place for general discussion of EV motoring in the UK (mostly).",2022,3,21
"I'm waiting on delivery of an E208 so I've used this forum quite extensively. My own interest in engineering and cars in particular mean I've gone into the Corsa section to see if the same questions are asked. I have never driven a Corsa so although I know the car and technology are the same I'm not aware how different the driving experience might be. Does the Corsa come with all the same dashboard, interior functions and options as a 208 or is the experience of buying and riving the car quite different (and I don't mean from a performance or handling perspective). 
 
If the purchasing options, driving performance (perspective?) and choice to me as a buyer are not the same then they should not share a thread. 
 
If, however this forum is for the real technical differences on how they are built, how they drive, range, 0-60 then they perhaps should share a forum. However, most questions I see on here tend to be about the experience of buying and driving the car in which case Stellantis want us to think they are different (nowhere on the Peugeot website does it tell me it's the same platform as the Vauxhall , Citroen, Fiat etc) then perhaps we should differentiate?",2022,3,21
"It’s also worth noting that while the platforms are similar a lot of the insides are different. A Corsa-E for example has a completely different dashboard system to the e208 or a e-c4. The Corsa-e also has, I believe, multiple settings on the stalks for things like the intermittent wiper function where Peugeots and Citroens are speed sensitive and adjust automatically. Intellilux lights are different to the Matrix LEDs used across the group. These are just day to day examples but they illustrate the point.  
 
I originally voted for ‘by body’ - but I think perhaps from a consumers perspective what sits underneath is an irrelevance. When you are needing help you want to understand and get guidance on what you touch and feel. 
 
Maybe ‘marque’ grouping would be a suitable way with sub Fora for models if deemed necessary.",2022,3,21
"All of the cars except for the Fiat 500 are on the same platform.  
 
The e208 and Corsa-e share the same body. 
 
The e-C4, e2008, Mokka-e and DS 3 eTense share the same body. 
 
 
The interior styling is different. There is overlap but they look different. The options are bundled differently. For example, the e-2008 has a better base sound system than the Citroen. However the Citroen has an optional upgrade while the Peugeot does not. 
 
There are more similarities than differences, but they are not the same. 
 
 
The real question is how best to organise and answer questions? People who ONLY want to know if there is an audio upgrade for the e-2008 are going to be best served by a dedicated e-2008 forum. Someone who is cross shopping will want to know about the sound system in all 4 of them. Do you ask the same question 4 times in each sub-forum?

"I think it makes more sense for each car to have a separate forum, regardless of them being owned by the same company and having the same underpinnings. I tested an e208 and a Corsa-E last week, both of which are built on the exact same platform. The infotainment is completely different though, and asking about a 3D dashboard in a Vauxhall forum would make me look like a twit. That 3D dash is amazing, but it's not worth the extra £5k over the Corsa I ordered. I am slightly worried about getting an older design, looking jealously at the new Mokka and Astra, and knowing that funky visor will come to the Corsa soon.",2022,3,21
"I'll let the poll run for a few days before doing anything. 
 
There isn't a clear winner at the moment. (I realise that I split the unique vote into three sub categories. I'll take the three together vs. grouping...)",2022,3,21
"This is a consumer led forum - not an engineering one. How many Vauxhall / Citroen / Fiat drivers are even aware of the corporate governance of the owning company? Why should they care? In my view - most people will be looking for the brand and car - and that's how it should be organised. It would be useful to then have a pinned discussion or information note ""that the following cars are similar and you may find useful information here too"".",2022,3,21
"Maybe a 'sticky' somewhere that new entrants arrive at, then, which list all the vehicles that have their own sub-forum and where to find that. (And, indirectly, also showing which models are NOT given a specific forum)

New Top level Name: 
 
Stellantis: Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat, Vauxhall and Opel 
 
2) Split the Corsa-E and Mokka-E into two sub-forums. 
 
Rename the current one to Corsa-E. Make a new Mokka-E sub-forum. I'll move posts as needed. 
 
3) Create a new Citroën Ami sub-forum in the Stellantis area.",2022,3,23
"A compromise as you say but it does follow the path of having the least amount of work for the admin people so they'll be pleased. 
It still leaves a bit of work to round up all the Vx Pug etc post which went into the general ev section and maybe elsewhere but truly the number of posts are so few it probably doesn't matter. 
The feeling is people looked for Vx etc, didn't find it and moved on rather than posting in the general group. 
After the update people will easily spot what they need to particularly if they realise nothing is in alphabetical order and will look much further down to find Citroën.

VW gets separate forums by marque and sub forums by model. The same should apply for Stellantis. Anything else is complicated and confusing and implies too much background knowledge for simpletons like me,2022,3,24
"Most regular car buyers - and let’s hope regular car buyers adopt EVs as quickly as possible - have no idea what Stelantis is, or care a jot. Please make the forum as accessible and welcoming as possible and avoid any approach which requires an explainer. Brand, model, alphabetical and comprehensive.

Dealership just called me. Rep told me she's just had a look at my car and she's charging beautifully and I should be able to collect her later. Hang on, I asked, what repair works has been done? What was the fault, what caused it, and how has it been fixed? She said she didn't know, but she'd get the expert technician to call me. I really hope they've not just cleared the fault logs and are sending me on my way. It's not fixing the fault. I also told her, the fault didn't happen when charging - I don't have a charging problem. Why is the fact that she's charging now indicative of the fault being fixed? Waiting for the call from the expert technician..",2016,5,27
"Expert technician called me. It's basically as I feared. Plug it in, clear the faults, car runs. He was nice enough, explaining to me basically that's how Renault works. If the fault reoccurs, they can apparently cross reference any new fault logs with the previous ones and try and diagnose from there. I'm disappointed as I hoped it would be more a case of plug it in, see the fault code, fix the fault. Anyway, the car's on test until Tuesday (after bank hol) and I'll collect her then.",2016,5,27

"Indeed. Some of the Q210s had a problem with a bad bearing. First replacements were ALL: Motor, drivetrain, PEB, BCB. Later, as I understand it, they made replacement kits with new bearings, proper procedure etc. Those first few (mine was in that batch) were costly repairs, several K's for sure, though on the other hand, it would be reasonable to put those units back in spare supply stock after bearing replacements. I don't want to think about the costs indeed had it been out the, IMHO, generous 5 year warranty on the drivetrain. Job was outstanding BTW.

"Sorry for not updating the thread until now. 
 
I got my Zoe back last Wednesday. She was in the dealership for 11 days altogether. When I collected her the service manager told me there's been no repair done as there is no fault. They plugged her in, cleared the long list of errors because, in their own words, the errors don't show them what caused the car to break down anyway, and unplugged. 
 
The error, according to the service manager, was probably due to a ""spike"" caused by (wait for it) ""an electrical pylon overhead"". !!! Being as the car broke down on a small country road in rural Yorkshire, with a total of zero overhead pylons in sight, I'm satisfied that, once again, this is evidence of the dealership playing pin the tail on the donkey and not really knowing what caused the error at all. 
 
Most worrying, perhaps, is that the service manager told me that Renault had told him that the car is not faulty. This, as the car told me ""STOP - Electrical Failure - DANGER"". But, Renault and the dealership say it's not faulty. There's no failure. There's no danger. So I guess it's designed to behave like this then. 
 
I'm now driving Zoe around normally awaiting for the fault to appear again. Never buying another Renault. Such a shame.",2016,6,10

"That price point is ridiculous. Having said that I believe it's slightly less simple as depicted by  @donald  though. When a batch of Q210 bearings turned out bad, the remedy was at first: 
- check transmission oil for metal filing; 
- if present, replace entire motor / reduction gear / differential. 
It was a rather major job and of course the ""part"" involved was very costly. Drivers (rightfully) checked their cars a bit more and I am pretty sure the fora helped raise awareness. On the other side of the coin: Renault didn't hesitate to take on the issue head on and lived up fully to the 5 year drive train warranty without moaning. 
 
After a while (I have been told), Renault came with a fix package. New bearings and an approved replacement procedure, probably at a price point of less than 10% of the motor replacement procedure. Any car mechanic worth his salt can replace a bearing.

Edit: When the motor was replaced, the car made a slightly different sound. Most noticeable is a soft whine or maybe a better word is whistle when regenerating that wasn't there before the repair. At least one other driver said the same after motor replacement.

Whenever you get a problem on a new car that won't go away it's always worth trying a different dealer. They may just do something differently that finds them the fault either by accident or on purpose.,2016,6,20
"My last car was a Fiat, bought from Arnold Clark, never had so much bother with a car as when I had to deal with Arnold Clark. Once the warranty was up I took car to an small local independant and bought software to check my cars computers myself. Car was with me 11 years, and is still on the road now, a brilliant car but the experience was almost ruined because of the dealer. I will never use an Arnold Clark dealer again, I was in a large community of unfortunates that bought from Arnold Clark until Arnold Clark had the site shut down ( ArnoldClarksucks.com, was full of horror stories). 
 
Next time you deal with Renault ask them if another dealer can look at it because you've lost confidence in Arnold Clarks ability to resolve the issue and suggest you've heard Parks in Dunfermline have the technical expertise. Whats the worst that can happen? They may say No and your no worse off for asking.",2016,6,20

"For what it is worth (probably not much: different country, different dealer, different culture, sample size of one); my experience though formally you are in a transaction with a dealer, it's so often that they let you down when things turn south. The (few) dealings I have had with Renault itself, read the Dutch representation, is that as long as you deal with them in a professional way and not having a ""demanding"" attitude and/or a piss over every tiny detail, they are extremely helpful and prepared to go the extra mile. There are forum members here that would almost certainly disagree with a passion. 
 
But let me just give an example: A Dutch forum member decided to drive all the way up to Geiranger Norway (2000+ miles) to join a huge EV event. He missed a crucial charger for his trip in rural Norway and unfortunately the road had a barrier in the middle and there was no way he could make a U turn for (from memory) 10 miles or more. Long story short, he found himself stranded, called Renault in the Netherlands, saying he got battery-empty stranded. ""Where are you now sir?"". ""In Norway"". ""Erm..... Norway you say? Erm, you know what, we'll call you back in a few"". And surely enough he was flatbedded to the nearest (no so near) charger pretty soon, was not ""thrown over the wall"" to the Norwegians to deal with this. Is it included in your contract? Sure. Can you expect to be assisted like this? Sure. Does it usually work this way with big companies? Your choice. 
 
Again, good luck with your dealings.

I wrote a letter stating that I wish to exercise my consumer rights by retuning the car for a replacement or refund and I'd be happy to accept either.

They wrote back to say I cannot reject the car as I've has the car for more than 6 months. They totally ignored my right to return and did not respond when I highlighted this. 
 
I wrote another letter to the dealer as my contract is with them. They have Been engaged in testing the car on different chargers and have found the fault I often receive, they are investigating if further for a report. It was not easy to get them to do this. Obviously this report will need to be analysed by all parties. The garage is still in contact with CS but they still won't respond to me. 
 
I contacted RCI to inform them of the negative impact all this has been having on my life and the financial loss I have incurred as result of purchasing this car over and above repayments. I again stated my consumer rights. This was about 3 weeks ago. I received a letter to say that the have opened a case for me and they will be investigating it further with the dealer and CS. I called last week to recieve an up date, the person who was assinged to deal with with my case was off unwell (these things happen) and they couldn't tell me much more. So I'm still patiently waiting. I truly don't think I'm being the unreasonable one here but maybe they see things differently. I'm hopping to hear more over the next couple of weeks. 
 
Kotek I understand that demanding, depending how it's done, can rub people up the wrong way but you need to be firm and have a strong stomach in my experience. They will (only in my experience) try to fob you off - damage limitation. It's just realistic from a business point of view that they do this but there has to be a tipping point - I'm still engaged in finding it.",2016,6,28
"I agree, Renault Customer Relations seem to be very good. I've just come off the phone with a rep, who called me to enquire as to the current situation. I told him that my Zoe was flatbedded to the supply dealership this morning, that I sent the New Car Sales Manager an email informing him that I intend to reject the vehicle and so please can he order me a brand new replacement, and that I am now in a hire car from Enterprise (Fiat 500, could be worse - and it's brand new with 2 miles on the clock). 
 
The Renault rep advised me that he will contact the dealership and arrange for me to have a meeting with the sales manager so we can discuss the options of my rejection of the Zoe.",2016,6,28
"It's good to know that there are some case handlers who are willing to be more helpful and offer I higher standard of customer service. Perhaps rejecting is easier than retuning. All the best going forward kotek. Myself, buzzar, eunicholas and others had a more drawn out experience but that doesn't mean that you will.",2016,6,28
@Kotek Besar  Have you contacted Citizens Advice?,2016,6,28
My car is still in Renault being repaired! lol,2016,6,28
"Big up to Arnold Clark Stiring. I just got off the phone with their service manager who has informed me that during their tests they were able to confirm that they found the fault when attempting to charge on 4 different rapid chargers. They were able to test the chargers as they had the equipment to do so with them. According to their findings the chargers were not at fault. They have put together a detailed report to put to renault technical who had previously said there didn't appear to be a fault with the car and blamed the chargers without testing them. Now renault technical won't accept the case from stirling because they are not an ev dealer. However they had a specalist carry out the tests and write the report to deliver to renault bishopbriggs who said there was no fault on the advice of renault technical. Bishopbriggs is an ev dealer so they need to raise the case with renault technical who will liase with (as they did previously) renault customer services. The report has also been sent to RCI. 
 
This is not my thread but I just wanted to point out that the dealer in this case has been most helpful. That being said it's important to log everything with all other parties as the dealer needs their help going forward if any replacement or refund is to be granted. Renault supplied the faulty product after all. 
 
Renault UK seem to make returning a faulty product a difficult process for the consumer. That being said I'd like to say that despite my experience to date perhaps I've been a bit unfair to renault CS department. Actually it seems the problem transcends them.",2016,6,28
"I'd be truly and honestly interested in the report. Before anyone thinks differently: to learn from it. As I've said in other threads, things can break in mysterious and unseen-before ways.",2016,6,28
Still in Renault no phone call as promised lol. the service has been abismal to say the least.,2016,6,29
"Never rely on a garage, dealer or manufacturer to phone you back. If they say they'll phone by wednesday, give them until the next day and then phone them. Or if they say by 3pm give them until 4pm and chase them.",2016,6,30
"Update: 
 
Zoe currently on her second visit the the supplying dealership for the STOP Electric Failure DANGER error. This visit is 9 days in, technicians still can't find the cause of the problem. Renault UK are aware of my intention to reject the vehicle, being as it presented as faulty within 6 months of delivery and the dealership were unsuccessful in their one attempt to fix the car that legislation mandates that I give them. Renault UK have spoken to the Sales Manager at the dealership and instructed him to set up a meeting with me so that he can present me with my ""options"" regarding the rejection. That meeting is to be today at 10:30. I'll let you know how it goes.",2016,7,7
Update: I postponed meeting until Tuesday 12th July due to my having to be elsewhere (dealership about 30 miles away from me).,2016,7,10
Take a witness ,2016,7,10
if you got a smart phone asked them if it's OK to record the meeting.,2016,7,10
Hi kotek. Did you have a favourable meeting? Are you any further forward? If you don't mind me asking :/,2016,7,13
"As it happens, I'm not long home from the dealership, having had the meeting with the sales manager today. 
 
The top and bottom of it is, I've agreed to the option of a replacement vehicle. The sales manager has calculated a figure that he needs from Renault, to make up the difference of what the Zoe is now worth and the deposit needed to start up a new 2 year PCP on a new Zoe at the same monthly payments as I'm on now (£95 batt + £35 car = £130 per month). The sales manager is waiting to hear back from Renault as to whether they are going to foot the bill, or whether they prefer me to simply walk away. 
 
My preference at this time is to change the faulty Zoe for a new one. An hour or so after the meeting my contact at Renault Customer Relations called me to say he's spoken with the sales manager after our meeting and he's aware of all that I wrote above. He will now pass this to his own manager to make a decision. I'm waiting to hear the outcome.",2016,7,13
"I can't see the financial motivation to pay you to keep you on the same deal you had with them. 
 
If they are not bothered about you as a customer, or bad feedback, then they'll just let you reject. Cheapest option for them. 
 
Paying out to keep you on the same deal is a big expense. 
 
Easiest option for everyone is to let you reject, then offer you a carrot of a good will gesture in a cash lump, so you can't really complain that Renault only did the bare minimum but they did actually recognise the inconvenience.",2016,7,14
"Well, my contact at Renault Customer Relations called me yesterday.  @donald  is correct, Renault have decided it's not worth their while changing the faulty car for a new one. Apparently it would cost them £5250 to bridge the gap between paying off the finance on the faulty Zoe and supplying a new one. Of course, these numbers are just show-and-tell anyway, the fact of the matter is simple - the car is dangerous, not free of defects and therefore not fit for purpose. You would think that a manufacturer as large as Renault would want to swiftly relieve me of the faulty car and swap it for a new one ASAP. But apparently not. 
 
So I sent the dealership a letter confirming my rejection of the faulty vehicle, enclosing with it the spare key and the V5C. I called RCI and they said they won't stop the payments until the dealership have contacted them. I'm not keen on cancelling the Direct Debit, at least for this month, as I don't wish to hurt my credit score. We'll see what the garage say now. 
 
Renault Customer Relations, by the way, cited their reason for not wanting to financially support the replacing of the vehicle as because the fault had not been replicated by the dealership on either of the two occasions the car had been in with them (it's still in with them). Renault suggest I take the car home and wait and see if it happens again. Sorry, I told him, not on your nelly. It's unreliable, unsafe and unfit for purpose. Makes me feel they don't believe me that the fault is present. Thank god I took photos. 
 
I certainly WON'T be buying another Renault again, ever.",2016,7,20
"@Kotek Besar  Sorry to hear that and a strange state of affairs. It's not that you programmed the word ""DANGER"" in the dash message. Good luck with the rest of this disappointing process :-/",2016,7,21
Hi kotek. I'm sorry to hear that. I really hoped that given the nature of your fault and your rejection rights that renault would be more ethically responsible. Of course it doesn't mean it's over but it doesn't need to be so arduous for the consumer either. I totally empathise. Come on renault this really isn't good enough! Let us know how you get on kotek. I'm still battling too. It's no fun!,2016,7,21
"Update: after 7 weeks of the mechanics not being able to find the fault, I sent an email to Renault customer service to ask if I need to also let the dealership that sold me the car have a go at it. There's some kind of rule that says the seller has to be informed of the error within 8 weeks (different country, different rules) and be allowed to try to repair it if you're going to return a product. Didn't get an answer to that, but the next day the dealership called and said that they've found the fault: the onboard charger was damaged. I guess Renault stepped up and finally helped them.  
 
Apparently they were not allowed to do anything with the car without having a Renault technician in France on the phone with them, to avoid injuries from high voltages or some such thing. Which explains the long wait.  
 
Now we're at week 11, it's supposed to be repaired around the end of July.",2016,7,21
Kotek contact trade and standards. They deal with these sorts of things all the time and should be able to give you the most accurate advice and put you in touch with all the relevant trade regulating bodies. The 2015 act gives you stronger rejection rights. In terms of the refund I think it takes in to account acceptable use but the product was faulty so it shouldn't be the second hand value. That's as far as I have been led to believe.,2016,7,21
"Totally agree it's all about interpretation, impact on the consumer and specific circumstances. Its just a shame that huge multinationals force honest consumers to take it that far before they practice ethically responsible trading IMHO. Ive seen this sort of attitude first hand in a pervious profession. I honestly don't mean to offend. I think its just the way the world works with a few exceptions - perhaps I'm cynical. 
 
Totally with badger in black on the replacement. Surely that makes sense all round",2016,7,22
"I believe this an appropriate tale for this thread, and one with (fingers x'd) a happy ending! I have had my Zoe back for 4 weeks now after 3 months in the workshop, have covered 600 miles since and, I'm pleased to say, it seems to be going better than ever. 
 
My Zoe first failed on 1st April. I finally received it back near the end of June. On 2 previous times I received it back I had to return it the same day. (Flatbed). Last time the Service Manager told me it had a string of faults and could be a while. (Electric Motor Failure). I took a hire car this time through Renault Customer Services. 
 
When I picked it up I was told they had replaced 12v battery, Inverter, and Motor. I'm sure other minor parts were changed also, and software updated. 
 
I think I have been very lucky to find a Service Dept who regarded it as a challenge to solve a thorny problem. Its worth noting that as all these vehicles are under warranty, the repairs have to be diagnosed and confirmed by Renault Technical and some dept in Renault is picking up the tab. I know the Motor change was approved during a personal visit by a member of Renault Technical. I'm sure that the quality of staff and knowledge is improving all the time as more training and experience is accruing. 
 
I believe that dealers do not hold spare parts on site and have to acquire these from Renault, who are obviously paying for them at present. Therefore no repair will be quick. (No more 'cleaned the plugs and adjusted the points and it ok now mate'!). In many cases the diagnosis is carried out by Renault Technical and the workshop is then supplied with the part and told how to fit it. 
 
When I bought the Zoe 18 months ago I had a lot of difficulties, and the dealer went through the process of getting a price from Renault etc to buy it back. (A process similar to Kotek's?). I don't know if it was genuine or just a 'blind' but nothing came of it. Remember that Sales sell the car, and the finance, and take your money and pick up the commission. Full Stop, next customer. After that it's down to the Workshop and Renault Customer Services. No dealer wants a 2nd hand Zoe on his books, so they need to get Renault to take it. 
 
I hope this will give encouragement to those on here whose difficulties I have been reading about. You have my sympathies and be assured you are not alone in your struggle against the mighty Renault, and sometimes the result is a good one. These faults occur out of the blue, and its a case of 'there but for the grace of God go I'. As I am constantly told, we are pioneers. 
 
Good luck to us all!",2016,7,24
That surprised me that they say it is not possible as we have done similar things with Santander before (although that time it was because we taxed the wrong car  ).,2016,7,28
"I thought I would check this with my RCI rep, as it didn't sound right, and his answer was 
 
""Yes my belief is that this is possible. You would need to speak to Customer Services and provide them with a ""nil balance invoice"" then we send a modifying agreement to the customer for them to sign and send back. They can be contacted on 0333 009 0230"" 
 
Obviously I didn't mention any names or dealerships and posed it as a hypothetical question.",2016,7,29
"Back from holidays, received a recorded delivery letter from Bristol Street Bradford. The postman forged my signature and popped it through my letterbox. Brilliant. 
 
In the letter, the New Car Sales Manager, who I had sent my rejection letter to, together with the spare key and V5C, says: 
 
 ""I refer to your letter dated 12 July 2016. I am sorry that your vehicle has had an issue requiring repair, and that it has taken 2 visits to our dealership for us to identify and diagnose the fault, which was only occurring very intermittently. 
 
I confirm that we have liaised with the Renault Technical team and propose to replace the PEC (Charger/converter) Unit to resolve the issue. This work would be carried out under warranty with no cost to you . 
 
Your letter states that you wish to reject the vehicle. Unfortunately, you are not entitled to do so. The fault first arose almost 6 months after you purchased the vehicle. Your initial remedy for any fault at this stage is to a repair, which we are proposing to provide, and not to a rejection. It is not unusual for vehicles to develop a fault and this does not provide an automatic right to reject. 
 
Please confirm that we can go ahead and carry out the repair. We will then contact you to collect your vehicle so that you can satisfy yourself that the fault has been resolved.""  
 
Needless to say, I'm thoroughly disgusted by that. Firstly, the sarcastic undertone is stomach-churning. ""Only occurring very intermittently"" - the car broke down and was rendered dangerous and not drivable. This happened twice since I owned the car, the first instance was just before it was six months old and the second instance was four weeks after that. 
 
The law says that if a new car presents a fault within six months of delivery I must allow the dealership one opportunity to repair it. I did that, they failed. The car was with them for 12 days. All they did was clear the error logs, test drive it, then tell me the issue was probably cause by an overhead electricity pylon. An invisible one, since there are none in sight in the place where the car broke down. They returned to me the un-repaired car, which, as stated, re-presented the same fault four weeks later. 
 
It's quite incomprehensible that Bristol Street seems to think The Consumer Rights Act 2015 doesn't apply to them. 
 
The sad thing is, if they'd have diagnosed the fault earlier and offered to replace the PEC (Power Electronic Controller) on the car's first presentation of the fault I would have had to have accepted the repair, which I would have done, without quibble. Rather, I believe Bristol Street didn't take the problem seriously, they failed to diagnose the fault, were more interested in trying to sell me tracking for my six months old tyres (they pushed this at least three times on me) than actually trying to fix the car. 
 
I haven't replied to the letter yet. I called Renault Customer Relations yesterday to speak with my case handler. He was on another call and his colleague said he would ask that he calls me back once he's free. I didn't receive a call back. I'll call him again shortly. The nightmare continues..",2016,8,19
"We have have owned 3 Zoe's to-date (Zoe No 1 was 9th in the UK) and all 3 have had this fault at on time or another and yes this fault is well know in Zoe's just read the forums. 
 
I have experienced this BCI first in May 2013 and on our Zoe-i that needed a new BCU just last month so Renault seem not to be on the ball with this one  
 
Best case scenario is lock the car walk away and BCI will clear after about half an hour. 
Worst case scenario when BCI will not clear Zoe was flat-bedded to Renault ZE Wolverhampton where it had a new BCU (battery charge controller unit) unit fitted and Zoe No 3 was away for a few weeks. 
 
This is our own experience with nothing made up! 
 
Do not charge the 12v battery or mess with any other part of the car as with our Zoe No1 wife and I where blamed for not plugging the charger plug in correctly (I kid you not) then it was the home chargers fault etc etc 
 
Zoe No 3 does seem fine now after its new BCU (at just 520miles) 
 
Zoe is a fantastic EV when running but can be a little flakey at times but stay with your Zoe as it will be repaired eventually but I repeat do not try to fix it yourself and why should you?",2016,8,19
"I have read your post three times. Let me start that I do understand the gist if the Consumer Rights Act, but know nothing of how that works in real life. It seems to apply to a car as well as to a 15 quid water cooker, which can complicate things when it comes to execution. With that said, it seems to me that you are right in the ""de jura"" sense. 
 
I think people should not be shoved around AND if you're on the short end you should act and not whine too much. Vote with your feet. Hats off to you. 
 
However.......... 
 
1. It seems you are furious at the dealer (don't blame you, that entire clear faults, pylon story is ridiculous!!), but (had they fixed it) quite happy with the car. I think it is something to consider: what do you really WANT? Reject the car because you're fed up with the dealer? To make a point? Or because you genuinely lost faith in your ZOE (after PEC replacement *) )? Or would you rather have a nice well behaving ZOE? 
 
2. You seem to be quite disappointed in the dealers reply. With the utmost respect, I think that is slightly naïve. They are just fighting back and like it or not, that is to be expected. 
 
3. I would be extremely careful to fight your fight in this public arena. Sure it can create leverage, but it can also create a ""drop dead you"" attitude. Rest assured that Renault UK and maybe your dealership follows this thread with more than casual interest and as said, the result can work for you or against you. If they will conclude at some moment in time feel there is literally nothing they can do to make you happy, rest assured they will do nothing.",2016,8,19
"Pompous nitpicking: it seems like dealers on your end of the pond make up the names of what they replace. BCU? PEC? Don't exist in the ZOE. If you want to get into a discussion with your chief mechanic: 
 
BCB: Connection box and charger (top metal box on the Q210) 
PEB: Inverter and DC/DC converter (metal box between the BCB and the motor on the Q210) 
LBC: battery management computer (inside the battery pack)",2016,8,19
"Make up names indeed as I have found these so-called experts to be so lacking in knowledge of the very expensive item that they are selling, quit incredible!",2016,8,19
"Perhaps you are right, it is to be expected that the dealership fights back, but in refusing to respect my rights under the law they are, very quickly, making very sure that I will not give them any future business. Often the way a firm handles a complaint has a significant influence on the customer's future buying decisions. 
 
Initially I wanted for the faulty Zoe to be replaced, and the dealership were willing to do this. Then when they asked Renault to support the funding of the replacement and Renault said no, the dealership's willingness to replace the car vanished. Right now, all I want is for my legal rights to be respected. The car presented a dangerous and immobilising fault within six months of purchase, I gave the dealership the opportunity to repair it and, while they kept the car in their possession for 12 days, they failed to repair it, they gave the car back to me and four weeks later the fault returned. 
 
I don't wish to whine, I wish to vote with my feet. I've respected the dealership's legal right to one attempt at repair. All I want now is for the dealership to respect my legal right to reject the car.",2016,8,19
"Spoken to my complaint handler at Renault Customer Relations. Renault are siding the dealership. They say I should allow the repair to proceed. 
 
Does legislation mean nothing in this country anymore? 
 
I also just came off the phone with RCI Finance. As the car is on PCP, and they are still taking my money every month, they have some responsibility. Amazingly, though I've been on and off the phone with them since day one about this issue, they haven't actually logged it as a complaint. Apparently that only happens when I utter the words ""I wish to make an official complaint"", otherwise all they do is log the call but do nothing. It used to be that any expression of customer dissatisfaction was a complaint and should be logged accordingly. Anyway, complaint with RCI now raised..",2016,8,19
"I suggest you go to your local CAB office. However you best check all your dates and receipts for ""work"" done.  
 
My concern would be if the first instance of taking car to dealer if they monitored car and saw no fault exhibited would this count towards the first repair if no repair took place. It's probably a grey minefield.",2016,8,19

Still paying battery rental and car repayments. Although I do have I courtesy car which the garage are making noise about getting back. I've asked for some assurances in writing before I take the car back. They replaced the BCB unit and have said it's fixed. All due respect - they have told me this before. The intermittent fault which has been present in the car since purchase still remained. All I'm asking is that they admit to me in writing that if I see the fault again within the warrenty period of the part that the most recent attempt to fix the problem has failed and that the underlying intermittent fault the car has shown since purchase still remains. They are so far refusing to do this. In the next breath though they tell me they are confident they have fixed the problem - go figure.,2016,8,19
"So last weekend was the first time I’ve used the rapid charge network in 5 years !!! And I can honestly say it’s as hard if not harder to get anywhere now even though I was using a 24kwh env200 and now I’m on 40kwh one . 
Facts- 
More charge points ( more reliable?? ) 
More Evs  
Scores more dumb uneducated drivers  
Arrived to find both rapids occupied both by drivers charging to 100% and wouldn’t move even though I explained kindly the etiquette. And another 2 the other day that arrived having no idea how to use the chargers and I had to wait for them to install and app , sort account out and basically f about . . Can only think this going to get worse . Now I do t believe people are being ignorant I just think the manufacturers are so keen to throw Evs out and not educating people.",2022,11,3
"The only way you can fix the 100% issue is at the network side. The charger could for instance simply stop once rates dip below a defined point. 
 
Its also much more nuanced than it once was... An older small battery car like a LEAF might struggle to get above 40kw at any point in its charge cycle, and will be tapering from 80% or even before if the battery is hot. An e-tron (or some other large battery car) might on the other hand pull 50kw all the way to 95%.",2022,11,3
They have the right to sit plugged to the very last dregs of available electrons. But when they use that to dogmatically claim that right is where it becomes debatable. If the futility of wasting half an hour of their lives to load an extra two miles of range is explained - and then ignored - then a different form of mindset is at work. People like that are out there.,2022,11,3
"Etiquette is for polite people but asking someone if they could move on would probably be met by resistance from a majority of people who have not been part of this group and even some that are  
Perhaps signs should be in place asking people to only charge above 85% if strictly necessary for their onward journey and to move to a slower chargerpoint if available. 
Of course, there's always going to be those who insist they need 100%  
One way to deal with things would be to make pricing increase from start to finish of the session. 
First 5 kW free next 5 at 10p then the next at an increasing rate which would encourage folk to move to a new session on slower equipment to get their 100% 
Sure you'd get people moving around all the time to minimise cost but it would free things up for others to start charging. 
Heavy fines for anyone just stretching leads.

"To be fair, the 'dumb EV drivers' probably used to be 'dumb fossil fuel powered vehicle drivers'.",2022,11,3
"Yesterday used an Osprey set of 3 fast chargers. A fiat 500 parked in end spot so I parked in middle to find that middle charger was being used by the fiat 500 and so had effectively blocked 1/3rd of the chargers.  
 
I had to move and luckily the 1st spot was free and working. A couple of weeks ago it was not so I would have been stuck.  
 
I don't know why they choose the middle charger the end one was working and cable would have easily reached.  
 
I guess education will help eventually.  
 
Mind you I broke etiquette as my appointment overran and I effectively blocked a spot as the car had stopped charging. I don't think it effected anyone as when I got back the fiat had gone and there were two spots available.  
 
I think we can all be dicks at times, sometimes unintentionally.  
 
BTW not every EV user will read such forums as this to understand etiquette.  
 
As an aside I had to go to my local hospital to pick up some medication for my other half. Lots of signage to keep left along long corridors. Lot's of folk who either can't read or don't care, so you can't get folk to do simple things even with nudging. So I don't expect it to get better as more folk get EVs",2022,11,3
"As a petrol or diesel driver I used to brim the tank when filling up, it follows on that the same habit would continue when fuelling up an EV for some drivers. I would imagine the mobile phone habit of always charging to 100% is also at work here. Some people including me are guilty of not reading the manual so are somewhat ignorant of the small print. Took me a few months of research and realisation when I first got an EV before realising its better to move on at 80% than to waste another hour waiting for that satisfying 100% to appear.",2022,11,3
"If people wish to charge to 100% that's their business - I don't have a home charger at the moment, when I use a rapid I will charge to 100% as it saves me from having to go back as often, I usually do this in the daytime and sit and work in the car. 
 
Networks which require apps, dedicated accounts, with pre-loaded credit, are a pain - this is why I use Bonnet as I don't need to care what might be needed to authenticate myself and pay. 
 
I don't believe it is the manufacturer's responsibility to educate - there are so many permutations of networks and how each of them work, I believe that the owner/driver should make sure they understand this most basic part of running an EV.",2022,11,3
I think a bigger problem I have found is people plugging in when they don't really need to. Met many people at chargers plugging in just so they can park close or just because the charger is unoccupied. They don't need the range to get where they are going. Then someone who is empty is forced to wait unnecessarily. With limited charge points if people can not charge when not required it will help all people get more chance of getting a charge when needed. I've seen a lot of people suggest to always be charging eg. Plug in whenever you can which I feel gives the wrong use case on rapids. On a destination charger sure,2022,11,3
i very much doubt someones plugging in unneccesarily on a charger these days when its costing about £37 per KWh,2022,11,3
"Paying by kWh, a unit that no longer increases proportionally to the amount of time taken using the hardware may be part of the reason why the person waiting is more impatient than the person on the charger.  
 
As I've mentioned many times, a time element need to be introduced on rapid chargers. Lessons are most effective when it costs money.  
 
 
How would that work? I'm not sure, I originally thought a flat per-minute rate would be good. But it is unfair to cars that are rapid-gating, not fault of the owner. Perhaps a per-minute sur-charge that gets introduced when charge rate drops below a certain point, let's say 10% of rapid charger capacity? (Eg. below 5 kW for a 50 kW unit, below 15 kW for a 150 kW unit)  
Just throwing ideas out there, open to suggestions.  
 
 
But root of the problem is lack of rapid charger stalls at each location. I quite like Supercharger V2 and Kempower's way of splitting available power to multiple stalls. This enables more cars plugged in and at very least starting a charge.  
More cars = more chargers at each location are required. It's really simple.",2022,11,3

"I was having a think about the subtle and not so subtle ways car manufacturers are trying to hold back the sale of EVs. Some I think is deliberate, others a happy coincidence they won't do anything about. 
 
Toyota: Adverts showing how you don't need to use a charger if you have a hybrid. Also calling the Lexus NX300h a ‘self charging hybrid’ inferring benefits of EV without charging hassle. Miss-direction by going down the H2 fuel cell route. Terrible EV mileage on the plug in Prius (compliance car). 
 
Nissan: Holding back on larger batteries and quirky 'marmite' design. 
 
VW: Advertising the GTE with the ICE as giving you the 'exciting' boost, inferring that 'boring' electricity does the rest. Selling the eGolf with only 80miles of range (BTW 2 blokes in their garage created a 200mile version). Uninformed sales staff who will redirect you away from EVs. eTron with terrible EV miles (compliance car). 
 
BMW: Quirky i3 design, high servicing costs, lobbying Hong Kong Govt away from EV only sales incentives 
 
Kia Soul: Quirky design, low range 
 
Fiat: The Chairman pleading with people not to buy the eFiat500. 
 
GM: Not following on from the Ampera in a serious way in the U.K. Where is the Bolt? 
 
Hyundai: Pricing the IONIQ plug-in hybrid $5k lower than the EV (How does an extra ICE drivetrain cost less than an extra 19kWh of batteries?) 
 
All manufacturers: 
Blinding/distracting consumers with 'jam tomorrow' concept cars. 
Software limiting acceleration (EVs cannot be seen to beat their expensive cash cows, can they?). 
Paying 'think tanks' or funding research to show EVs as producing more brake and tire dust. 
High servicing costs relative to work involved. 
Long lead build times in spite of high demand (eg ZOE 6 months, ICONQ 8-10 months, Golf GTE taken off market).

"Interesting thread, the thoughts of an industry insider below which I thought were relevant (from an old (Jan 2015) thread on PH) 
 
“ 
The day that battery technology improves by approx another 30 to 50%, is the day that ALL internal combustion engine energy converters become obsolete. This is because once you reach ZERO tailpipe emissions every single environmental issue / problem and COST simply become SEP! (Someone Else's Problem) 
 
With EU6+ emissions design development and then homologating costing upwards of £100M per platform, moving to a fully electric car cuts costs to such a degree that no OEM can afford not to do it. 
 
Think of the range of issues that go away completely, and soon, having ANY kind of engine is going to become seriously un-cool. And the savings just keep on coming, for example, On Board Diagnostics, and conformity of production simply disapear, because when an electric car breaks down it does not pollute (unlike say an ICE with a misfire). Cat ageing, DPFs, DMFs, SCRs, Urea injectors, high pressure common rail pumps, evaporative emissions, multiple drive cycles, testing on world wide fuels at a huge range of temperatures, thermosat monitoring, misfire monitoring, catalyst monitoring, injector ageing, etc etc etc all simply disappear, saving MILLIONS! 
 
So, if i asked you for say £200M to develop a new world beating ICE architecture, you would rightly say ""what are the risks""? and the risk is that your idea becomes a white elephant over night....... 
“",2018,1,4
"An advantage with EVs is that you in effect choose where the highest emissions take place. ie the AC power source is the polluter. Shift to low carbon and hey presto nothing comes out of the vehicle or its power source. 
With an ICE the makers all provide various levels of performance and various levels of what comes out the tail pipe. If you drive hard then more stuff is poured out. If you stop start in a city then more and more stuff comes out. But an EV can be driven as hard and with as high a performance as you wish to achieve and the output stays the same at the point of use. So there is a sort of perverse incentive to make EVS as high a performance as your construction budget can stretch to. Perhaps thats the attrcation. No longer do you need a BMW M series to get performance, as the same motor could poitentially deliver a large amount or a low amount of performance (Within its own limitations) depending on how its set up. Thats how TESLA work, why build loads of different motors with very little cost difference when you can just use one and set up the drive inverter differntly. The inverter is probably the most limiting part after the battery pack. 
Fun times.  
Dont forget TESLA uses a lot of parts from OEMs, Early S had AUDI, Landrover, Mercedes, and probably more components in it. No idea what the imported content is now.",2018,1,5
"1) Established manufacturers will on ship fully formed and ""complete"" product, they do not and I doubt ever will do a ship MVP thing that is Tesla's wheelhouse. 
2) They will not commit to producing if they can source supply chain that is capable of support continuous production, as having a stopped line is a sure fire way of losing people and lots o'money. 
 
BMW or more accurately the Quandt family have been quietly pushing money around for the last decade to ensure number 2 is sorted, BMW etc will not suffer from the ""production hell"" scenario they will turn the tap on and produce. 
 
The competitive advantage of the incumbents has nothing to do with dealers, car design or any of that stuff as they are still producing badly designed cars. Its supply chain and getting to market at volume, look at the vastness of the VAG and BMW product and options catalogues. 
 
This is why the 2020 timeframe is significant, thats when Samsung SDI Hungary are at full chat, and the second Moses Lake Facility for BMW CFRP will also be full steam ahead. I believe LG Chem also have a factory coming online at the same time somewhere in Europe, and the lack of a factory at full chat is almost certainly going to be gating on the IPace and the XJ BEV thats about to follow. 
 
Don't necessarily look at the lack of BEV's from mainstream manufacturers, look at their supply chain investments and you can see where they are going in the next 2-5years. 
 
Tesla clearly have the early mover advantage, and to a greater or lesser extant so do any manufacturers with a BEV in the market now, but Tesla is helpfully pouring billions into maturing a market all to the benefit of those who have not that much flesh in the game.",2018,1,5
"I think Seba is unrealistic regards 2025 because he doesn't seem to have factored in that its not enough for the EVs to be cheaper, they need to be  available  and battery supply will be the obvious bottleneck, given a 3 or 4 year lag between raising investment capital and producing batteries at minimum, so that complete replacement  cannot  happen by 2025 though perhaps it could by 2030 or so, and I also think he's 100% wrong about autonomous cars for multiple mundane reasons that  I've only seen one article call him out on . Essentially his predictions regards autonomy rely on human behaviour being totally driven by economics and logic. 
 
On the other hand, people who make reasonable and non dramatic predictions dont get to spend their life touring the globe making a living from their predictions, and if he makes a few people think and dig into whats happening and buying an EV a year or two earlier, thats not a bad thing.",2018,1,6
"The delay in the mass production of the Model 3 gives other manufacturers time to produce their own versions. So we may see a wide range of vehicles come to market at about the same time before the Model 3 has achieved a dominant sales position. It is now odds on a 60 kWh LEAF hatchback (world car design) will be available sooner in the UK and cheaper than a Model 3 sedan (mainly US market design) with the same size battery.  
 
It would appear that Musk has major problems with the Model 3 production line running at speed because of vibration. The placement and welding robots have insufficient mass to damp vibration when the line speed is increased towards the intended running rate. Sounds like a rebuild of the production line is the only lasting solution which will take time and cash.",2018,1,6
"It looks as if there will be several long range mid size cars available from different manufacturers sometime next year, however will they all be on such lead times as they almost might as well not be available then?

Yes, no UK M3 until 2019. Now try getting an eGolf, Ioniq, or heck even a low capacity hybrid like the Golf GTE right now. Battery availability seems to be the bottleneck for all these, not something so easily rectified, no pun intended.

"@Siraff , worse than that I've not seen ONE independent study that shows why 200 is the ""magic"" number. 
 
It could be 250, 300, 500, 1000. Who knows? It seems far more likely that the EPA set this number around the original Roadster, and the decision was based around lobbying. (For all NEDC's ill's at least the cycle is based on statistical journey analysis). 
 
I learnt something fascinating today. The term ""designated driver"", was actually a marketing term, paid to be injected into soap operas, and daytime TV show scripts. I genuinely wonder if 200 mile minimums, and ""range anxiety"", are of similar derivation. 
 
One thing is for certain, there are very very few ICE cars with <200 mile tanks, and frankly I suspect even then the range of a car is maybe the 99th thing on the typical car buyers list. 
 
I actually happen to own a < 200 mile ICE. Not once did this limit really show itself as a problem. (And I've driven it from the Arctic Circle to the Black Sea). 
 
The key difference between my 200 mile ICE (and that's driving carefully, 180 is more common) is the ability to not have to carry around stupid apps to work out where petrol stations are, or when I got there not being able to use the pump because I wasn't in the special club, or stuck in a queue behind people doing the equivalent of extreme couponing.  
 
Where having such a small fuel tank does get on my nerves, is occasionally when I'm using it summer to do commutes (at least when we get a whole week of sunshine) because I visit the petrol station more frequently, but this objection is ruled out with an EV.",2018,2,15
"Just to speak up for the little man here   
I used to commute, round trip, 45 miles a day, 5 days a week. Back then EV's in the current form just didn't exist. 
Now retired, living in the same place, my longer regular social trips are again 45 miles round trip (and no, I DEFINATELY do not visit my old workplace). The majority of my social trips are less, some as little as 6 miles. 
Thus an EV that has a decent headroom above 45 will do me. It took a week or so of searching for reasons why it wouldn't 'do for me' before I climbed over that psychological hump, acceptingd the fact that a range of 60 miles gave enough headroom for driving in the hilly Peak District, making regular use of full throttle, cold weather range reduction, and possible battery degradation over 3 years. 
 
I even counted the longer trips I've done over the last 3 years, deciding that for those 6 trips a year I could manage the 'charge on route' problem, especially as I believe the useabilty of the charging infrastructure can only improve. 
By the same justification I can absorb any ad-hoc longer trips that might arise. 
 
There are other reasons why I've bought something with a range in excess of 100 miles, but it means that I laugh at 'range anxiety'. The concept of carrying a petrol engine, with its increased purchase and tax costs, simply has no appeal at all. 
 
Not every one will rush in, and that's fine by me, but I believe there is an untapped market of people whose bodies might have retired, but whose brains are not yet comatose and can accept new ways of living.

"Absolute range is meaningless when you can't charge quickly or the range is unachievable at motorway speeds. We are currently in a battery-size war, similar to the meaningless megapixel war for DSLR.  
 
In order to promote EV and give people a good idea how it will replace their ICE car, manufacturers should strive to make the most efficient EV at motorway speed. Good EV range in town is already achieved by 1st gen vehicles with moderate battery (100 miles in stop-start traffic is quite a long time). Next generation EV need to tackle real world long distance road trips. 
 
So for all EV on the market, there could be a single figure: Time to do 600miles/1000km. Not many people will drive further than this in one day, so with this time figure, people can easily see all critical features of potential EV that they may not aware when coming from ICE. This figure will combine EV range, charging speed and high speed efficiency. 
 
The time figure can be calculated by measuring distance driving at 68mph/110kph 100% to 10% and from 80% to 10%. Also need to measure repeated charging time from 10% to 80%. Then just add the numbers up to calculate how long it would take to travel that distance. For consistency, assume always stop at 10% and immediately able to start charging. 
 
For example, Leaf 2 40kWh seems to have charging speed problems:  Worried about Leaf 2 rapid charging rate!  This is on top of not improved motorway efficiency. 
Whereas Hyundai Ioniq even with only 28kWh can achieve almost similar ""Time to do 600 miles"" on motorway as 40kWh Leaf. Ioniq can charge at close to 100kW. So the 40kWh is really quite meaningless. 
I expect current best time is achieved by Tesla Model 3 long-range. Combining Supercharging speed with really good motorway efficacy and battery thermo management.",2018,2,16
"It's a combination of things and people. 
The EV lovers like us   will put up with a lot more:- 
Short range. 
Paying more than we should to be an EV'er. 
If you could get a 100 mile range, that could charge in 10/15minutes, that we be a big breakthrough. 
Until then the, longer the range the better, to appeal to the man in the street, at a cheaper price. 
My 30 KwH Leaf was great, apart from Christmas trips and driving holidays. 
As a devoted Ev'er, stopping and charging can be part of the fun for being 'one of the enlightened"".  
However, it is not fun for 'real people', with kids and others, who do not want to spend hours charging!!  
The EV car industry is a crushing disappointment just now, and 2018 does not look like the breakthrough year we were promised/dreamed of. 
We have the Tesla. 
Nissan have a NEW car with limited supply, and too expensive. 
The Zoe deliveries are not good either. 
The rest are nowhere, and have show their contempt for EV's. 
ICE manufacturers are playing a game, but show no signs of offering an affordable, available, EV, in the near future. 
In essence we are still pioneers. 
We should see a few more Tesla's, and a NEW Leaf & Zoe or two, but you can whistle for the rest. 
The dealership's attitude will still be the same, offering more attractive ICE cars for the money. 
The big car this year will be the EV jaguar. 
Great car in limited supply, at a high price. 
Porsche too, are making strides, at the top end of the market. 
Until the ICE companies start building 'EV' factories, and sort out battery supplies for volume production, nothing will change.

It is left to the devoted few to make EV's work in our daily lives. 
Sometimes have a second ICE car, or hiring one to make it all work. 
The hybrid is the best of two worlds just now.

"Hello everyone. 
 
I test drove Opel Corsa-e (registered in 2020 November) and I loved it! I currently have fiat 500, with 13.5s to 100... Corsa was on another level, heaps above that. And I loved how it hugged the road... I was a bit shocked by how fast the range was dropping, driving it in sports through some bends and ups and downs... and a few km at 150 and 130 on the motorway... but okay, it is what it is... and I was researching charging stations after I came home, and it's not that bad to charge it... and 95% of the time we will charge it at home. the lack of battery % is the dumbest thing ever though, and I've now read that the range estimates are wonky at best 
 
now for the main issue... infotainment/main screen was VERY lackluster. There is a phone, nav, photos/SMS, music, and very few car settings, like auto-dimming the lights, auto-locking, etc... 
I and wifey were trying to get some battery management stuff to come up, but we could only get some basic version of it on the driver's screen. 
we went into the handbook, and there was mention of ""eflow"" button, etc... but our car simply didn't have that. Our car seems to have a smaller screen and no buttons to the left and right of the volume knob. 
 
I then went searching for reviews online and they all have those buttons... so what the f. is up with that?

The high cost of import is less of an issue here as used car prices are so much higher. While you can pick up an early leaf for £7k in Britain, it would cost me €5k just to get a 1990 Fiat Panda Elettra with 2 seats, lead batteries and a range of 35km. 
 
On a wider note, thinking about Fiat and electric vehicles, you have to consider that Fiat sell over half of their annual European production in Italy, so unless something works in Italy they are unlikely to do it. Here are a couple of the reasons why the spread of electric cars in Italy is going to be difficult without some changes at a national level. Firstly, power limits. In Italy we can't just use as much power as our main fuse can take at any moment and be charged for it, we have to choose a limit (3kW, 4.5 kW, or 6kW) and the standing charge jumps for those requesting a higher limit. From this you'll see that having a domestic 6.6kW charger is not possible as you are already over the highest limit, so you are left with 3.3kW, which is unattractive to many. Secondly, electricity prices are much higher here than other parts of Europe. It would cost me €8 to charge a 24kWh battery from 0 - 100%, and that is more than it costs for the equivalent distance worth of petrol in our Punto. So, unless you really want to, and there are some (but not many) people that do want to, there is no economic case for the switch yet, and until there is then people won't switch and Fiat won't spend money building cars that they can't sell at home regardless of the views of their boss.",2017,10,18
"If electricity prices are so high in Sicily then that is where the problem lies, and is where the people should be focussed on forcing change. That is, of course, unless someone is being made 'an offer they can't refuse', to keep things as they are.  
 
In a place with a great sunshine record the answer could be for everyone to install PV. Payback times would be short due to the mains price. Coupled with home battery storage then local EV transport would be very economical.",2017,10,18
You make some good points but I don't want to turn the thread into a discussion about Italian politics. I was just trying to point out that Fiat's lack of enthusiasm is due to more than Marchionne.,2017,10,18
"Hopefully when Mercedes starts competing in Formula E, Ferrari will have a change of heart and go head to toe with them in the 2019/20 season. Then maybe the 500e will finally have its day in the sun and Italy will change its opinion of EV's and all the necessary incentives to get them accepted... ",2017,10,18
"If you are thinking of importing one, I'd first have a word with your local Fiat garage. 
You don't want to get it, and go there with a problem and they say there's no way they are looking at it, as they don't have any manuals, diagrams tools etc, training , for the HV system.....  
 
But I too wish they'd sell one in the UK as a Zoe / eUp rival .... I'm sure it would go down well in the Nordics and low countries.",2017,10,20
"You can add me to the list of 500 owners who would've happily traded in their 500 for an ""e"" here in the UK! I have owned nothing but FIATs and Alfas all my life. The 500 with an electric motor must be such a joy to zip about in! It has always been a great city car, so electrification would seem to be the obvious next step in its evolution. Its great to hear that they are still going strong after 3 yrs too. Bodes well.  
 
Real shame we cant get any in Europe. Instead, next week, (hopefully) I am driving my current 500L Diesel over to BMW, where it is being part-exed for a brand new BMW i3 94ah rex.  
 
Sorry FIAT, you literally gave me no option..... Also, my other car is a Renault. ",2017,10,23

Just watched an article of Fully Charged about converting a Fiat 500 to full EV for about £5k. Also been watching a few episodes of Vintage Voltage with interest.",2022,4,7
"Just buy an early e-Golf. You'll end up with a more refined and long term supported product with greater safety. A 5-7 year old Polo is just Meh, uninteresting. Converting an older car means that you will have to spend considerably on restoring the shell and accepting a lot of old trim and ancillaries that are past their prime. It will never be ""safe"" in comparison to a newer car, and even less so once converted. If some 3rd party rights off your ""classic"" then replacement would be challenging, with a standard car it'll likely be freely available on the open market at approximately the insurance value. 
 
If you want to DIY as a bit of fun and learning exercise then that's a different matter. Employing someone else seems pointless.",2022,4,7
"Ouch just looking, they not cheap are they?",2022,4,7
"No EV is cheap at the moment (even as a donor of parts), but the e-Golf are readily available. They are about 50% more than the equivalent LEAF, but that's the same as an ICE Golf to a Nissan Pulsar.",2022,4,7
Saw that  @Mkultra . Looks great! The Transition One offer of £5k modification is only in France and after govt subsidy. Don't think it's commercially available in France yet though.,2022,4,7
From the reports on here they are boringly reliable and don't keep their owners awake at night worrying about battery degradation or software updates. About all that there is to do is to modify them to make them look like Golf R ...... - where's  @buck eejit  when you need him?,2022,4,7
"A company called ZeroEV are local to me and do this kind of conversion, you can find them on You tube. I met the owner at fully charged live we had a good conversation on the economics of conversions vs buying a purpose made EV. As has been noted already the bespoke nature of the work means it will never be cost effective unless you use one of their existing conversion kits even then it's not cost effective to do for most people.",2022,4,7
"Converting an ICE is probably not the way to go if you just want a 2nd car, there are many LEAF with poor battery health which would make ideal candidates for a battery swap to non original battery type. 
There will be a market for this if it can be done at realistic cost",2022,4,7
To what end? Buying a newer LEAF is better value.,2022,4,7
"Secondary markets always emerge. It will for sure. I don't think that is in doubt. Whether it be non branded printer cartridges or a whole sub industry of after market products or services. But it seems now is not that time unless you have deep pockets.  
 
I'd still be interested give the dice a roll. But at a price point lower than those listed by Zero-EV. I think the £20k price point mentioned by cah197 is probably more realistic. 
 
And yet we have TV programs dedicated to doing just that, retro fitting cars from ICE to EV. And these folks do not seem short of business. But they tend towards the mid to top of market it appears. 
 
The Transition-One approach is maybe the baby slopes of that market. If you search ebay there are plenty of Tesla and Leaf products starting to be listed and sold. And I think there is an article of Fully Charged about replacing or upgrading a Leaf battery to improve range. Not quite the same thing but it will come. 
 
Does anyone know of anyone who has had one of these conversions done who would be happy to share their opinions after spending the money? Would be very interesting to get someone's take who had actually gone through this ... good or bad as that might be.",2022,4,8
"After being interested in the 500e for quite a while, I was finally able to have a test drive last week at my local Fiat garage. Looks like I was the first to try it, as it only had 8 miles on the clock! 
 
In general the car is a real quantum leap over the old 500. I always loved the look of the old 500, and actually bought one in 2009. However I sold it soon after as it was pretty crap to drive. This new electric model improves on the old car in pretty much every conceivable way. 
 
Positives: 
 
Looks great in the metal. 
Finally a good driving position in a 500! Lots of adjustment in the seat and steering wheel. You can sit noticeably lower compared to the old 500. 
The central display in the La Prima I drove was responsive and crisp, wireless CarPlay worked faultlessly. 
Radar cruise and auto lane hold worked very well. 
Performance felt decent. Nippy away from the lights. 
Amazing turning circle! 
I didn't have time to fully test the efficiency, but it seemed pretty good. Range was stated at 160 miles at 100% when I first got in, I drove for 13 miles at a stated 4 mi/kwh on a mixture of motorway and town driving and got back with 7% used and 147 miles left on the GOM.  
 
Negatives 
 
Although the interior looks great, there are a few bits where the materials feel cheap. 
The ride was generally good, but it tended to thump over serious bumps. Nowhere near as bad as the old 500 though. 
 
Overall I really liked it! It's a pity I couldn't keep it for longer to really see what the efficiency is like and what it's like to live with. I'd also be interested to see what deals are available, at the right price it could be a really compelling package!",2021,4,24

"The Fiat forum looks quiet, so just a short post here to see if I can catch some advice. 
 
We've been offered a 500e as a rental car, but would like to know if it will cover my wife's daily 100 mile round trip commute at 60-70mph all the way, heating on, etc. 
 
Our Zoe uses about 40kWh to do that in today's weather so the Fiat's 42kWh battery seems a bit tight unless its efficiency is better than the Zoe. 
 
Thanks for any advice!",2022,12,2
"Is that 100 miles each direction or 50 miles each way?  
 
I'd think not quite but if it's only temporary ie a few weeks it might be ok if there is charging somewhere. Granny charge at work? The fiat comes with a brick. Top speed might have to be shaved to 65 rather than 70. 
 
Onto have given a few youtube channels the 500e for a month so it's worth checking out what they have been doing with them. There's a sudden flurry of 500e content.  
 
Corsa E wouldn't and you also have the lying useless range meter that would show 200 miles to start then by half battery it would probably be showing 60-70 miles max which does not give confidence. 
 
Can you get another Zoe ie a rental EV that actually does the trip ok?",2022,12,2
I believe the 500e battery is only 37kWh usable. EV Database quote ranges of between 100 miles (cold highway driving) to 220 miles (warm urban).,2022,12,2
"Leaf is really bad in cold weather. You lose even more capacity as it has no thermal battery management at all. It is however very quiet and well built. First day I had it to do 100 miles in a day we had to stop on the way back for a coffee and a top up as it was so squeaky bum. I wasn't impressed. 
 
The cabin temperature of 24c in a Zoe is about 20-21 in normal car though. The Leaf would melt her face off at 24c. I had to put it down to 19.5 as that was close to the 23C or so I had to have in the Zoe to get any heat at all out of it ",2022,12,2
"199 WLTP I'd be disappointed if you couldn't get it to do 100 miles. As its a rental charging to 100% every day woudln't be an issue and if you have off street charging I'd think it'd be fine? 
 
as mentioned, for a temporary vehicle if it struggles in really cold/wet weather dropping the speed by a few mph will make barely a dent in the trip length but help with the 'MPG'",2022,12,2
"Thanks guys. My dilemma is that it won't be me driving it and I'm not sure wifey wants to add a need to charge at the destination to what is already an excessively long day. I might have been a bit pessimistic with my Zoe consumption estimate, but it's still in the 30-40kWh range at this time of year. With 37kWh usable as mentioned above, that's not much margin for a bad weather evening. 
 
To top it all, wife is tied up at work in meetings, and I'm loath to make the call without talking to her first as it affects her most. On the other hand, the £75 a week the ICE is costing us for the commute makes getting back to a £2 a day EV commute quite attractive!",2022,12,2
"A month of range anxiety? I'd live with that personally but if it were my Wife I wouldn't want to live with her living with that.    
I can't believe that it's not going to achieve 3 miles/kWh even in the winter, even my MG4 managed it. An e-tron 55 on the other hand...",2022,12,2
"Yup, if it was summer I wouldn't be fretting, but I know from experience that cheaper EVs like the Zoe, and presumably the Fiat if it's at all like the other cheaper Stellantis EVs, struggle once the mercury gets lower, and we're heading to the coldest part of the year. Also, the repair time for the Zoe is ""undefined"" because the part they need is unavailable and they say the only way to get up the priority list is to hand the car in to the garage, lol.",2022,12,2
What other cars can be rented? I'd think a long range MG4 would be better. Or can they get the 62kWh leaf?,2022,12,2
"Not a huge choice, Renault offer just a basic car to keep us on the road while the Zoe's on its sick bed. So the 500e, a Leaf or a small ICE (Micra, Aygo, something like that).",2022,12,2
"Don't you have a rubber doorstop to tiewrap behind the accelerator? 
 
Gaz",2022,12,2
"I'd have thought that the Leaf will do 100 miles most days, as long as its nearer 60mph than 70. I would say my e+, with the bigger battery, would be OK for 150 under most conditions, and it's got <50% more range than the standard model. (Even though the battery is slightly over 50% more capacity, it isn't as efficient due to the weight increase.) 
 
But you will need to know where to charge on a really bad day. And obviously, if your wife can see it is going to be a bad day, slow down and reduce heating.",2022,12,2
"Thanks all!  
Finally managed to catch the wife on the phone. As I suspected, with us heading to the coldest part of the year and with a fairly high stretch to go over on the commute she was reluctant to add more faff and worry to what is, to be fair, already a very long day for her. We decided to plump for the small ICE in the end to eliminate any worries. 
 
Pity really, as my wife loves the Zoe and wouldn't be without it, but a change with such impactful possible consequences being made sight unseen was understandably a step too far. 
 
It's a ""curse of the early-adopter"" type of scenario - if this had come up in six months then charging at the destination would not have been an issue as her work intends to install a row of 22kW chargers but for now she would be reliant on a single CPS rapid and an unreliable 22kW post in a village where the Tesla drivers like to get their fill of the free charging.",2022,12,2

Hi... can anyone advise please... my wife loves the 500 .. we've had 3 and now are thinking to go electric... test driven 2 at 2 showrooms ... the only thing that's stopping us ordering is a possible issue with the brakes... on both demonstrater cars when at really low speed.. as if in traffic and creeping forward.. the brakes make a horrendous squeaking sound... it happened on both demo cars... the sales guys both said it had never been heard before and FIAT have no reported issues with this problem... but when I researched it online there were a few review websites who mentioned this issue a while back... the main one being a carwow review by Mat Watson... can anyone who had bought a new 500e in the last 6 months please confirm or deny if they've had any such noise on their electric 500e ? It's the only thing that's stopping us ordering one... but if those demo cards were mine and I sat in traffic day after day with that squeaking every time ..I would go mad... thanks for any help,2022,8,4
"Brakes on EVs frequently don't see a lot of use due to regen braking.

"I've noticed with my Ioniq if I leave it parked up for a few days unused, particularly if it was raining the last time I drove it. When driven again the brakes make a scraping sound but not a squeak, the sound clears after a few deliberate hard braking applications as the surface rust is removed from the disks. 
 
Maybe arrange another test drive and deliberately overuse the brakes to see if the squeak reduces or even disappears. Demo cars may not be used very often so the disk surfaces have time to oxidise a bit.",2022,8,5

"We've had our 500e since last November and have now covered ~4000 miles. 
 
Most braking is via regen, so the brakes on the wheels are not applied, however when they are used (ie by pressing the brake pedal) no squeaking. 
 
It is good practice with EV's to apply the brakes every week or two to remove any rust build up on the disks. I do this fairly gently, but at speed - 50mph - having first checked there is no-one behind me of course!",2022,8,16
"Our Zoe makes a strange Squeak coming off the brakes rather than applying them, I'm guessing its something to do with the Regen. I can only hear it with the windows down and the radio off so not too bothered about it, same as the weird harmonics I get at 60mph, I got used to it and don't notice it as much. 
 
However EV's are more susceptible to strange sounds which are normally masked on ICE vehicles so it is a problem, but if you turn the stereo up most of them go away ",2022,8,16
Actually having watched quite a few Carwow test drives lately this is quite a common problem and not just a Fiat but even some very expensive cars have annoying sounds from the brakes sometimes. Matt usually likes to make fun of this trait introducing random picture of certain birds or other animals. ,2022,8,16

"Hi, 
I normally drive a Zoe but it's going off the road today, possibly for some time, for a repair. I've been offered a Fiat 500e as a replacement, It's possibly the 42kWh version, but I don't know if other sizes are available - the garage quoted a 160 mile range but the Fiat website says ""up to 199"". 
 
I'm just wondering if there's any ""gotchas"" about having a different car temporarily, eg. 
 
1. My wife does a 100 mile round trip commute at 60-70mph. Will the car need charged to get back home? At this time of yea our Zoe uses around 40kWh to make that journey. 
 
2. Does the Fiat have standard (type 2) home charging? We have a Zappi at home. 
 
3. Is the Fiat CCS for fast charging? 
 
Anything else we should watch out for?",2022,12,2
"I've owned one for a year. There is 28kwh battery option but 42 is the standard. 
In summer, the guess-o-range has been as high as 195 but 165 is currently range in these temps. 
Don't do much fast road driving in it, but this week took it 45miles to dealer for service, dual carriageway, 60s mph, got 4.2 m/kwh, so your 100 mile trip should be fine. 
Type 2 charger for home and CCS for fast stuff.  
Great little car IMO",2022,12,2
"I've gone from driving a Zoe ZE50 to my current 500e, and I can tell you that the main issue will be that you and your wife might want the swap to be permanent (as long as you can deal with the smaller boot size and the lack of rear doors, of course). 
 
The GOM has never gone over 161mi for me (I've in fact driven  from north London to Brighton and back  on a single charge, but it was summer and we went the slow way through London both ways)... I think that a 100mi commute shold be fine, although perhaps I'd recommend switching to 'sherpa mode' when the SoC gets under 20% just to be on the safe side. 
 
CCS is supposed to be up to 85kW, I only rapid-charged twice with Osprey 50kW chargers and got around 43 IIRC. 
 
Which trim are you being offered?",2022,12,2
"Mine is also showing 165 miles in this cold weather. But with climate control on it will be less (140?). Try not to change the charging settings and it should be left on level 3. When i first got mine a played around with this setting and switched it to level 5 for rapid charging resulting in battery error message that wouldn’t go away and had to take it in for a service. 
 
preheating the cabin via the app or pre scheduled time will consume about 2% of your battery in cold conditions. I use one step regeneration mode (RANGE mode) and (NORMAL mode) in traffic jams and parking as it coasts and not so jerky.

I have a feeling fiat will tell me to take it to my dealer but it's under warranty but I need a car to get to work and back so it's not like I can leave my car with them longer than 4 to 5 hours as I start work at 3pm.",2022,12,2
My 12v battery is leaking so pretty sure this is the issue,2022,12,3
"That's pretty poor. It suggests there's a manufacturing defect and should qualify for a warranty replacement. They should also sort out any damage to the paintwork if the leak extends that far. 
Also, request a courtesy car so you are not left without transport.",2022,12,3
Is there breakdown cover on it? Stellantis cars usually have RAC cover on them. That might be the quickest way to get a new 12v.,2022,12,3
"Hi there   
 
I have ordered a fiat 500e icon on lease which will come in march, i had ordered a 208 gt premium petrol but they have had a recall on the car and delivery will be god knows when and i need to make sure i had a car for when my current lease went back end of march to start/mid april. 
 
So i took the plunge as i wanted a EV (i do not drive far tbh) and this car was really the only one i could afford at the time i ordered it about a week ago.....other cars have prices raised ALOT and alot of cars and petrol ones have 8 weeks delivery some i have seen 6 months wait lol. 
 
Anyway for the time being i will not be getting a home charger as the prices of them are ridiculous, i am sure they are charging way way over the odds for them, 700-1200. there have been a few for 549 etc but these are with the grant off WHICH if i tried to order now would be too late anyway as they do not have slots for instillation before the grant ends and so id be paying full price....literally can not afford it, plus i am pretty sure we would need something upgraded with the main fuse too. 
 
I plan on using public chargers, there is a pub near me that has a free 50kw charger long as you are in the pub, me and my friend meet once a month for fee and usually in there atleast 3 hrs talking so it should give decent range, and there are others locally that you pay for but still cheaper than petrol. 
 
i do not mind using a granny cable at home for inbetween tbh. 
 
anyway the question is what cables come with the car, as in the description it just stays ....Charging Cable - Mode 3  
 
would that be the 7kw one where you can either plug it into a home wall charger and public chargers that are 7kw, do you get the granny cable at all as i do not fancy paying £170 for one. 
 
many thanks",2022,2,3
"Mode 3 is the granny cable. See my earlier thread on this as its confusing. After Aug last year, any order placed on the fiat system, regardless of trim level, will come with the 'faster' charge cable. However, sounds like you have ordered a 'stock car' so it may well have been ordered before Aug. I placed order with dealer in Sept for Nov delivery, but the original order was put on the system in May, so didn't come with the 2nd cable as standard. The dealer had led me to believe the 2nd cable would be included, so in my case they provided the cable free of charge.",2022,2,4

Sadly it's only available in California and Fiat don't want you to buy one as they're making a loss! 
 
Does anyone know if Fiat plans to bring it over the pond?",2015,8,6
"None at all. It's a California compliance car. If they don't build it and sell it they can't sell any cars there, or not as easily. 
 
They could sell it here too, but choose not to. They're not alone. There's a UK RHD Ford Focus EV that's been available for 2 years, not that you'd know it. They've sold about 19 in that time.",2015,8,6

"I enjoy driving our little Fiat 500e over in California and feel one of these would make a perfect runabout when we are over in the UK. Most of the non EV parts are standard Fiat 500 so in theory it shouldn't be too expensive to maintain standard wear items, tyres, brakes, wipers etc. Some inexpensive reliable Fiat 500e 2013 models here in California can be found for less than $5000. Looking at the cost to ship from the US to the UK should be less than $1000 according to :  How Much Does Shipping a Car Overseas Cost? - CostHelper  
 
Once this pandemic has declined, I'm sorely tempted to buy another 500e then pack up our current 500e for the UK but not sure about the current UK car inspection requirements. Looking at the VAT impact it should be zero as it has been owned by us outside the EU (if that even matters anymore) for almost two years. Essentially everything except the drive train and some of the trim is standard Fiat 500 especially safety elements so I would think there would be no additional inspection items required? 
 
Here's an example of a 2016 500e for $5991  https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/828502330/overview/  
 
Any thoughts - or am I totally crazy?",2020,11,19
"Crazy! perhaps a bit too much time in that Californian sun. 
 
A car with the steering wheel on the wrong side, will not make a convenient city runabout! 
Not to mention and shipping costs and import duties will probably cost the same as several monthly car payments",2020,11,19
"Well plenty of Chevys and Mustangs get imported with no trouble. You just need to get an estimate of taxes and duties from a shipping company. There are specialists around who can handle all the paperwork to import. 
 
I wouldn't worry about the steering wheel on the other side - you get used to it. 
 
But after all the cost, it might be cheaper and easier to get a Zoe/VW eUp or similar. As suggested above. 
 
Or wait until Fiat release the new e500 in the UK, with some good PCP deals.",2020,11,19
"Sounds like a great idea, until you have an issue with the HV system and there is no one in the UK who has ever see one before... that would be my worry 
 
So if you are the adventurous sort and don't mind the odd headache you will have a cheap and fun city runabout. 
 
Like that car and want to keep it, do it, I had a mate who emigrated to Australia in the 80s and he took his beloved Daimler Sovereign Coupe there with him, the price I recall was higher than you are paying now! Bloke from work went to Australia a few years ago and took his RS4 with him exactly for the same reason.",2020,11,19
As it will be permanently imported it will have to be fitted with UK legal lights which may or may not be cheap to do. I know someone who got badly stung by this with a Jaguar which he though would save him money over UK prices but ended up being more expensive. I think there is also an import duty to pay unless it is over a certain age.,2020,11,19
Import duty will be the biggest problem I reckon. Unless there’s some kind of exemption for bringing over your own personal car (which I doubt).,2020,11,19
"When importing a car from the America to the UK, you can do so completely tax free if you have owned the car for at least six months and have lived outside the EU for over 12 months. 
 
 If these criteria don’t apply then cars built in the EU are subject to £50 duty and 20% VAT, based on the amount you paid for the car, with those built outside of the EU coming in at 10% duty and 20% VAT.  
 
Most cars that are over 30 years old will qualify for 5% import VAT and no duty when being imported, providing they haven’t been significantly modified from their original use and are not intended to be your daily driver.",2020,11,19
Always a good idea to get the pros and cons down on a piece of paper and cost against alternatives.,2020,11,19
"Indeed, note the bit above, given you were thinking of purchasing a second one, you really need to make sure it is going to fulfill the ownership criteria. 
 
Biggest change at the back is a fog light, and not sure if the headlamps need replacing once you bring it over, but given the parts are likely shared with the UK 500 it should be easy enough to source them.",2020,11,19
"Do it!  
 
There are lots of pros and cons here, but I expect that the reason you want it is more to do with the heart than the head. The main question for me would be if you have the time to do the research and paperwork etc, but it is a fun project and one that could be interesting. 
 
p.s. Fancy bringing one over for me   Sounds perfect for bombing round town.",2020,11,19

Would it be considered rude to point out that Fiat are now taking orders for a much improved 500e to Europe & the UK for the 2021 model year?,2020,11,19
"Is it $5000 plus importation costs? or will it be more expensive than that? 
 
So for an extra 20k you can have much improved..... I am assuming range, how much would that be per mile of additional and possibly un needed city car range.",2020,11,19
"The California spec. Fiat 500e doesn't have rapid charging, but I suppose you already know that.",2020,11,19
Best to get an insurance quote too. Car is an oddball and some companies won't insure it.,2020,11,19
"I just bought a Fiat 500e and I love it. I live in Provo and there are public charge points everywhere. Last night, the day after I bought the car, it was keyed by someone straight to the metal. I live in a rather good part of town and it was in a private drive for the night. Unfortunately, I have to park on the street most of the time and the car is bright orange. I learned due to gentrification there is a huge anti-tech sentiment here akin to San Francisco. I've bought a camera and switched up my insurance but that doesn't help for the damage already done. What on Earth could I do to prevent this from happening again? Is it safe to leave it at public charging ports? What if they do something worse like snapping the charge port while unattended?",2019,2,10
"If it was, as you suggest, ""anti-tech"", does it advertise itself as being electric? If so, take the badges off so it looks like any other Fiat 500... 
 
Ofcourse that doesnt help when your plugged in at public chargers, but then the car was keyed in your driveway... 
 
Given the model (it surely doesnt stand out as an EV unless someones paying a lot of attention to it...), it seems less likely to me that it was keyed because it was an EV, and more likely either a jealous neighbour, or just a random freak coincidence by a passer by etc.",2019,2,11

So a 30 sat nav signal displays as 20 mph.... 60 as 40mph etc. Lovely car, but this software bug is very annoying, and Fiat does not seem to have any answers!!!",2021,7,13

"The 500e is going on sale imminently in the UK (the new version). Not sure what colour/location brake lights and indicators the US 500e has, or what fog lights/reflectors it has. The modifications to make it compliant could be costly. I can't recall if the 500e has rapid charging, but if it's CCS Type 1 you will not be able to rapid charge anywhere (we use CCS Type 2). Also while the Type 1 inlet will accept 230v, will it be happy at 50hz rather than 60? I'd hope so but not sure.",2020,11,19

"Had to the bite the bullet and go full EV as the Zoe is getting a bit too wheezy to be relied on to do 24,000 miles per year! That's too high a mileage to be able to keep the car for a long time, so we decided to add a second EV so that it shares the load. Second car usage is currently much lower, so the combined mileage is 30,000 and the shared load will be 15,000 per year, which hopefully the Zoe will cope with. 
 
Decided the Soul was our best option in terms of £/kWh of battery, as we needed the best range we could afford since we are giving up the ICEV range comfort blanket. 
 
Found a nice 10 month old top-spec Soul, should get it by end of Feb all being well. Have to say it's massively solid feeling car, bit like a big Jeep. Aiming to keep it for 7 years or so, so having 6 years of warranty is a good feeling too.",2023,2,20

"Summary 
 
 Audi confirms two new pure electric cars will enter production. 
 First up is the R8 eTron super-sportscar, to be unveiled in January 2015. 
 Far more important is the 300-mile range EV family car, set to start production in calendar year 2017. 
 Audi looks serious about competing with Tesla. 
 Volkswagen makes ten million cars per year, and has huge procurement scale and manufacturing efficiency advantages. 
 http://m.seekingalpha.com/article/2...300-mile-range-ev-plans-to-compete-with-tesla",2014,11,22
It's nice to see the pick up of all types of EV's,2014,11,22
"Are they going to compete with the MS or the III? 
 
If it is the III, they may get out of the gate ahead of Tesla.",2014,11,23
"I've been harping on about EVs for a long long time and since well before the Nissan Leaf. People were well used to me going on about 'crazy stupid' ideas and seeing me in wacky cars. It's good to see that EVs now are well and truly here to stay and that the development of EVs is most certainly main stream. Much the same as with petrol/diesel cars it takes a while before things become affordable but the pace there is also quite staggering too. It took a lot longer for the Austin 7 to arrive on the scene. 
 
Oh and by the way I am very much a petrol head and always will be but I am also very very much committed to EVs too. It's good to see BMW and Audi in the EV market, surely everyone knows that all the salesmen in the country will now be demanding they have one on their drive as a company car and the rest of the sheep will follow. ",2014,11,23
"I'm inclined to agree with the ""halo effect"" or whatever marketing speak you want to call it. When I look around the (any) office car park it is easy to pick out the cars belonging to different types of people. e.g. at the extreme there are people who will laugh at Skoda, Seat and even VW but believe their Audi is a world-beating vehicle. Others who still crow about BMW being the ""ultimate driving machine"", a marketing campaign for which I have seen the internal slides - the car companies know exactly what their target market is and how to play it.  
 
Much as Elon Musk funded the Model S with the roadster (and lots of loans), you can fund a lot of research by marketing to ""status-anxious"" people. They'll happily pay £20000 on top of a normal car in order to have the nominal capability of reaching 60 mph two seconds earlier. They'll even give up three seats, a boot and a roof for it. Just look at the limited run ""Type R"" type cars where people pay  more  money for a car which is missing the rear seats, air conditioning, radio ... 
 
So making an electric R8, at £40000 more than the petrol one, is a nice little earner. No effort required to make it faster either - that comes naturally. 
 
You are quite right that the 300 mile family car is more important for the 95% of us who don't consider our car to represent our status. But we may as well make money out of the 5% to bring the cost down for the rest of us and feed them whatever rubbish it takes (including the increase in performance arising from not fitting a radio!)",2014,11,23
"What I would be interested to know about is the process that made Audi switch from chickening out on the electric A2 (which as a diesel A2 driver I am still mourning) to a point where they are aspiring to leadership status in the premium EV market. What happened to change their minds? Whatever it was they are now followers, not leaders.",2014,11,23
"Tesla happened. They proved people will pay a premium for a nice looking high performing car electric car. Not as many people will pay that premium for a Leaf, or Focus EV, Jazz EV etc. the electric A2 would have been a compliance car, same as the 500e. It probably wouldn't have even gone on sale here. With the R8 they will get excited journalists, excited fanbois, and the same revenue as they would from the A2 project, and the same CARB credits. Audi can probably even charge more for the R8 than Tesla can, because Audi is a known trusted brand with existing dealers.  
 
It's good news as far as I'm concerned, because it means the plugin variants of the A4, A6, Q5 etc will not be far behind, and electrifying those cars even a little bit has a huge impact on net emissions.",2014,11,23
"500e got a lot of excited and journos, much to Fiat's dismay it would seem.   
 
Oh, and back on topic, an A1 e-tron would be lovely please.",2014,11,23
"It's worth remembering that in the ICE world, margins are much higher on moderately expensive cars (top end models of more popular ranges) than those in the mass market, so it becomes easier for your first model using a new expensive tech to be in that price bracket, because it becomes easier to price it against equivalent ICEs and not take quite so much of a bath on the business case. If I was Tesla I would be worried about an A7 e-Tron eating into my Model III funding mechanism.",2014,11,23
"No real evidence that Audi are going to do anything mainstream - could all be just vapourware. 300 miles NEDC for the family car so probably 200 miles real world range or less if it ever gets launched. Pricing unknown. 
 
Interesting that the article is written by someone who is short Tesla shares.",2014,11,23
"Better late than never, but I'll believe it when I see it. The wife's Q7 is due for changing in April and Audi more than any mainstream manufacturer has, through being late out of the blocks absolutely nothing to offer me or interest me. Actually scratch that, neither has Jaguar Land Rover.",2014,11,23
"from autoblog today; 
 
It's no secret that Audi respects  Tesla , and  there have been hints  that The House of Quattro is ready to really flex its progress-through-technology muscles in Tesla's direction. Audi will be applying lessons learned in the development of the coming  R8 E-tron  to the future electric car, after it  managed to double the range  of the electric sports car thanks to new battery technology to 450 kilometers, or 281 miles. 
 
This puts another tentative all-electric Audi in the mix and another Tesla competitor, after rumors of  a possible electric Q8  from February of this year. If an electric  Q8  does happen, it's expected to be a challenger to the  Tesla Model X . And that might not be all:  Bloomberg  reported in June  that Audi had ""devised blueprints for several high-performance electric saloons and sport-utility vehicles.""

Baby driving may get 90 and I've seen over 100 on my meter.. 
Vegas is hot, so AC loads are always there.. 
I forget how horrible gas cars are!!!! When ever I'm in one now, it seams noisy, shifts randomly, is slow and delayed between foot and road speed. I can't say enough good things about this car..

"Picked ours up yesterday. Very pleased with it. 
 
Trip was typically nightmarish. We bought it from a garage in Cheshire about 100miles away. We asked them to fully charge it as we didn’t want to have to charge on our first trip. Despite a weeks notice and nagging them, when we turned up, it was sat on the charger. We left the dealership with about 60% charge. Thought we would pop into the local Morrison’s and use their charger. That was a bit of a mistake - the Friday crowd were in shopping and the charger is by the in ramp. Reversing across the traffic was a challenge! Had the usual first time charging a new car challenges but got to meet a lovely local guy in an iPace! Needless to say neither of us could get the Genie Point charger working (they had network problems). So gave up and set off. 
 
Stopped at the osprey charger on the A55. It worked ok but it was getting dark and was raining by then.

"Hi All,  
 
I was wondering if anyone had any advice. I collect my Fiat 500e this weekend, it comes with a free wall charger (The EasyWallBox be Engie). However I am struggling to get anyone to Install it. 
 
It can be plugged into a standard mains outlet for 2.3KW, or installed properly for 7KW. It has a DPM sensor for monitoring the load on the main fuse. 
 
Ive got a call with Western Power (I am in South Wales) to takes us off a loop and upgrade our fuse to 80A (From 63A), and so far I have had two installers say they cannot help as they are not 'accredited' for that charger. I contacted Fiat and they said to contact Engie, Engie said they do not keep a list of installer and instead just sent me the Installation manual for installers. All the other installers ive contacted have either not responded to their ""contact me"" form, or don't answer the phone 
 
Has anyone had any luck getting this charger installed? 
 
I appreciate that most people would just get a podpoint or something installed instead of the Fiat one if they had to buy one.",2021,7,27
I don't understand why an installer would think they need to be accredited for a particular charger. I know there is huge demand at the moment so maybe they're just too busy to bother with something unfamiliar.,2021,7,28
"As  @mikeselectricstuff  stuff said, there is no legal requirement for accreditation, over and above being a competent electrician and (for England and Wales) being a member of one of the Part P cartels. Any electrician could easily install any charge point, it's not more complex than wiring a hot tub. Day's work at the most, often they only take half a day if the installation is straightforward. Only slight complication is registering the grant application, but that really isn't that difficult or time consuming.",2021,7,28
"Yeah, I was a bit confused about it. Ive not even been able to get a quote from anyone yet. Despite contacting 8 electricians that indicate they install EV chargers. I guess it must be down to their business as you say.",2021,7,28
"To add, this isnt the case with every manufacturer...",2021,7,29
"EO are likely to find themselves in hot water with that clause. This wouldn't be the first time that a manufacturer has tried to create a closed shop like this. A heat pump manufacturer (more accurately a UK distributor) tried the same trick with me years ago, and tried to make out that the product only had a warranty if installed by one of their accredited installers. As I'd bought the thing from a wholesaler, had all the competences and qualifications needed to install it, and had no intention of spending as much as I'd paid for it to get a (pretty pointless for me) chit just to do one installation, I challenged them. Have to say they didn't even argue about it when challenged. I offered to send them photos, but they just backed right off and made it clear that they legally had to honour the warranty as long as the unit was installed as per their MIs. 
 
If anyone gets this sort of challenge from any charge point supplier/manufacturer then I think they need to challenge it. The one proviso is that manufacturers can choose to offer an extended warranty, over and above any statutory warranty, that may be dependent on certain conditions being met. Even then I believe that the onus would be on them to prove that the installation was in some way non-compliant with their MIs, and that the failure was a consequence of shortcomings in the installation. That's probably a pretty tough thing for them to prove, especially if the installer has taken photos at the time (I do this all the time now, as much to assist my memory as anything else). 
 
As an aside, the tendency by manufacturers to try and create closed shops is something that seems to be getting more common. I'm pleased to see that the ""Right to Repair"" movement seems to be countering this to some extent. When my Macbook needs replacing it won't be with another one, that's for sure, it will most probably be this ""designed to be repaired/upgraded"" laptop:  Framework Laptop pre-orders are now open  , primarily because I do not like the way Apple are trying very hard to stop anyone other than their own stores fixing their stuff.",2021,7,29
"Again, back to mikes original query with regards to why installers feel they have to gain the accreditation... 
 
Installers arent going to want to argue t&cs with the manufacturer, regardless of law, easier just to get accredited accordingly... 
 
With regards to doing the accreditation, it all depends on how busy that installer is... they will just say no to spending a few hours sending certs off and doing additional online courses (or whatever the manufacturer requires them to do) if they are too busy.

Seen an article and that first editions will be nearly £30k in the U.K. This is a silly price for what is just a city runabout. Why did they not go for a smaller battery and a more basic trim and get the price below £20k. At this rate EVs will continue to be out of reach for most people on average incomes.

"Just thought I'd do a thread on what having a Corsa E is like. I often find test drives and reviews don't really find some of the issues that owners have all the time. 
 
Driving: pretty good. Far more lively than the Leaf. Ride quality is a bit more bobbly and unsettled but it's a lot firmer and less of a blancmange. It's more like the Zoe R90 I had but a bit taughter. It's more eager to get up and go than the Leaf and a lot more eager than the Zoe R110 which seemed subdued compared to the R90. It doesn't hop on bumps like the Zoe either. It seems to be better controlled in the rear. 
 
Interior does have a lot of scratchy cheap plastic. I can't hear any of it squeaking or rattling though yet so that's a bonus. The suspension is more noisy than the Leaf but I have to check all the stuff in the under boot floor section is secure as if the towing eye is in there that might explain the odd noises from the rear. Seat and steering wheel are properly adjustable and there is a foot rest. 
 
First job has been to get the Vauxhall connect app working. The website and app look very like the Nissan one... the connect process is the same. Mine is still in the process of sorting itself out. It can see the car and where it is but there isn't the battery details yet (ie the bit I want). Hopefully that will happen over the weekend. 
 
Most annoying thing found so far is the bluetooth audio seems reluctant to connect and start with that as a source each time. I keep getting the radio   I'm hoping once I've been in it a few times it will stop being thick and just reconnect and carry on where it left off. Annoyingly getting back into the Leaf from having set up the corsa at the showroom the Leaf did exactly that.  
 
The vauxhall website suggests you get 3 years free servicing but there seems to be some doubt with the dealer whether that applies with the ex demo cars. That was one of the reasons I was attracted to the Corsa so it will be annoying if there is that exclusion and the website hasn't made it clear. It does say Corsa E up to 10 months old so I'd expect any sold before the end date should qualify.  
 
There are no mats as they're on back order. I have ordered some normal 2020 corsa ones from amazon to use for now. Dealer has been waiting since the beginning of time for the mats. 
 
I still haven't found out whether you can use the heater/stereo etc while rapid charging either. This is a slight concern as it was on my list of things that would exclude having a model altogether.",2020,8,21
"Update. I took my Corsa in to the dealer's today for the proximity locking fix, but sadly no fix yet as they couldn't get the required file off the Peugeot server. They are going to collect my car next Tuesday and return it with the fix (hopefully).",2023,4,5

"The dealer arranged collection of my car yesterday, and surprise, surprise, they needed to keep it for another day. I didn't have high hopes, but I got a call this afternoon to say that proximity locking is restored. They say that the latest Body Control software recall deliberately disables proximity locking because several people have locked the keys in the car. I'm not sure I believe that though. The menu will have no reference to it, but it has been enabled via OBDII. 
 
Apparently it took so long because Vauxhall kept closing the case before the dealer was able to download the files required.",2023,4,12

Many thanks",2023,4,12

"@ym7   
 
i probably wouldn't get a leaf. Winter range is poor and it's chademo and the charge speed is poor. Build quality is better but the infotainment etc and interior is like a museum. Also they don't have steering wheel reach adjust until late 2020 so earlier ones can be uncomfortable. 
 
Corsa is ok but let down by poor software and often useless dealers. Still miss the headlights as they are excellent. It is fun to drive too. I checked my old one and it's showing a recall so that's at least the second it's had in only 2 years. Outside warranty I think it could be bothersome as too many owners seem to have had problems. 
 
Zoe ZE50 is more efficient but has poor NCAP safety. I'd check out its failings. if it's just rear passengers and you don't have them then it won't matter. I'd try one. Certain ones have the 5 year warranty not the lesser one. They're a safer buy. There's been some silly cheap ones about.",2023,5,15

"Giving some feedback from the other side...we've had our Corsa-e Elite Nav since October 2021 i think it was and, at the risk of sparking an avalanche of issues, its been great to be honest. I love driving it, my wife loves driving it and we use it loads.  
 
It was never bought with the intention of needing to do long journeys as we have a big ICE Insignia estate for that as long trips generally mean dragging along our daughter, the dog who has a crash tested cage in the boot of the Insignia and other stuff so the Corsa wouldnt be big enough anyway. However we have found ourselves doing some longer trips in it as we got more confident in using it which in reality was us getting used to what it can do. Yes you dont get as much in the winter but you just adjust accordingly, that said its not something that really affects us. Its main use is local running round and for that its great. I love the nippiness of it and i suspect we get rid of a lot of the software niggles as we pretty much use CarPlay all the time.  
 
I recently updated the Infotainment which wasnt a great process especially as i tried to do the sat nav as well which it wouldnt so i gave up on that. The app is crap but to be honest i dont really se it much, scheduled preconditioning is set up and just happens now at the times we need to do it and rarely needs changing, the odd adhoc preconditioning i've done ok when i've needed to and i dont check charging these days since my wifes work got more reliable chargers installed which now just work....the fact they are free and we hardly ever charge at home is a big bonus!!",2023,5,16

That’s what they said. Not sure what they meant,2023,5,17
"I expect what they mean by ""stalling"" is the engine traction error fault, which would stop the car running. I've heard of some cars stopping in live lanes of motor ways (you can't even coast them)",2023,5,18
"I called my local dealer - not the one I bought the car from, as they wanted £5k more - and it's booked in. First available appointment was the 2nd of August. I have 3 long journeys planned before then, two 800 mile round trips, and one 1200 mile round trip. That'll pretty much triple my mileage before it gets fixed. I'm sure it'll be fine!  
 
My van is also subject to the recall, I'm pretty sure it's  all   Stellantis EVs built on the PSA platform (so everything except the Fiat 500e). I have queried it with the company, but at the moment the silence is deafening, perhaps because we're in the process of transitioning our fleet management from a cut-price company which never hit a single target, to an even cheaper one. A few years ago we had our own in house fleet management department, perhaps when this dèbacle ends we'll go back to that.",2023,5,18
"Peugeot customer service is, in some ways anyway, excellent. If you post a query on their website (with your VIN number to prove it's your car) you get an actual phone call the next day, usually from someone who is actually French (to go with the French car theme   ). Sometimes things get lost in translation, and/or you get the feeling that the customer service person only really knows about ICE cars, but hey imagine getting service like that from Facebook or Amazon etc. 
 
Anyway their customer service person explained that they don't know which of their cars have the affected air conditioning compressor (whatever that is). Presumably the 'stalling' only occurs when this component fails, so this sounds like an unlikely event to happen to any one individual if that is reassuring (I've not read anyone mentioning this fault on this site), so it sounds like a rare but risky event. Who wants to be stranded on a motorway with an immovable 1 and a half ton piece of metal.",2023,5,18
"Let’s see if I can get a sensible answer on this forum 😉 
I had the new recall update installed on Tuesday by Vauxhall which only took about 30 minutes. The following day I had the ‘battery charge’ fault come up followed a short while later by the ‘traction battery’ fault. I carried out the ‘disconnect reconnect’ of the 12v positive quick release lead, firmly reconnecting it, and all seems to be ok at the moment (touch wood). I am wondering firstly if as part of the rebooting process after the software update Vauxhall disconnect the 12v lead and thus could have caused the issue and secondly if a dielectric grease applied to the 12v battery terminal may help keep a good electrical contact.",2023,5,19

When it reached 80%, the charge stopped - I presumed it was to stop people hogging the charger, but then I saw ""traction system fault"" on the display. It drove OK, with a warning triangle. When I got back to the caravan, I opened the bonnet to see what kind of spanner I might need to disconnect the 12v battery - but found it was quick release! I'm leaving it for 10 minutes, then I'll try to reconnect and hope the error goes away. I'll need to charge at least 3 times tomorrow, on my 400 mile journey home!

"We have had a 500E La Prima for around 6 weeks now and we can confirm there are some issues which we suspect are SW related. 
 
There are inconsistences with the relationship between battery charge level and range. i.e. We charged to 100% and the range dropped by 23 miles before the battery capacity reduced to 99%. The range then reduced by 2 miles when the charge level reduced to 98% Regardless of driving style I would expect there to be a more accurate correlation between these 2 measurements. 1% = 23 miles and then 1% = 2 miles is not very helpful. 
 
The speed and range were set for MPH and and Miles respectively. 3 times now, these settings have randomly switched to Kmh and Km and had to be reset in the units settings. When I saw the speedo at 47 I though a speeding ticket would be arriving soon but then realised the display was in Km/h 
 
With the car switched off and locked, when you plug in a charge cable the radio bursts into life for around 20 seconds. 
 
The battery capacity varies quite a bit from charge to charge. On 17th July a 100% charge indicated a potential range of 205 Miles in SHERPA mode. On 30th July, 100% indixcated 165 Miles in SHERPA mode. 
 
This is not SW related but we also have concerns with the E-Mode selection switch on the centre console. Twice now, my partner has accidentally put the car into SHERPA mode whilst I was driving around 70mph. This causes the car to suddenly brake and reduce speed to 50mph. The E-Mode switch is on the passenger side of the centre console. She mistook it for the volume control. In left hand drive vehciles this would not be such a problem. 
 
I am logging these type of occurrences and will present them to the dealer and FIAT customer services as appropriate but it does look like there should, perhaps, have ben a bit more regression testing. 
 
Other than that, we love the car and would recommend it.",2021,8,3

"Still made zero progress with setting up connected services, I'm hoping this will give better battery management since coming from teslafi where every drive is logged on a website the data available is a bit light. We're finding the start/stop button a bit odd. Surely it shouldn't be necessary to turn the car off before locking it? But then the lights/radio stay on and charging timers are ignored. 
 
Its very clear that 'EV' options are an afterthought in the radio software. No way to 'charge now' if schedules are set (and who won't have scheduled charging if they have a dual rate tariff?), and most of the display cards seem fairly inaccurate. I've not managed to get a sensible watt hour/mile display, 0.3 kWh/M mile really isn't accurate enough.",2021,8,9

Hi there, I have a 500e icon on lease and it was all going good untill a month ago I kept getting a onscreen warning saying something is wrong with the passenger airbag and the SOS assistance. 
 
I called fiat and they said take it to my local dealer but I didn't have time as it's 16 mile away and I go to work. But then as of a couple of week ago I was sometimes getting a seatbelt warning symbol and sound and it seemed to only happen when I was turning left lol....I tried to pull on the seatbelt in different directions and where it clips in to recreate the warning but it never happene donly when I drive and turn left. 
 
And now I keep getting all those warning but no it says one pedal driving unavailable and to use the normal break...and yep in range and Sherpa when this wanting happens I take foot of accelerator and the car keeps going...no refen breaking 
 
Just drove from work tonight and I had to drive 5 mile with all these warnings going off. I stopped my car twice turned it off but still happened. 
 
I've had the car since may I think it is...end of April start of may. 
 
And to top all that off last week lifting my boot lid I heard something rolling around inside my boot door/lid...where inside the boot you have that odd plastic that's coated in material covering the boot lid/door internals it sounds like sometjings come off inside there and rolling around when I'm driving or opening the boot.

"Hi, 
We are close to ordering a new fiat 500e, but I am interested in the service intervals and cost. The dealer are saying the intervals are every 12 months or 9000 miles..? Is this correct for an electric car.? Surely there is nothing much to service as it has very little moving parts.? 
If anybody has knowledge of this any information would be appreciated.",2021,8,28

"I've contacted my local dealer (not the one supplying ) and they said they didn't have any details on frequency nor cost ....... There's cars being driven I find it pretty unacceptable tbh.  
 
They said 'ah well - the cars probably won't need servicing for 12 months so we've got plenty of time'....... 
 
Also we're picking ours up in September. We didn't get offered the servicing package. Is that a fiat wide offer or something the dealer can elect to provide?",2021,8,29
"I spoke to the dealer again when we placed our order yesterday... and they confirmed service is every 12 months...! This is ridiculous, my Skoda enyaq is every 24 months...! 
 
There is an offer for fixed price servicing of £299 for 3 years... I think this is only available if using PCP finance..

Does the included services cover rusted brake disks?,2021,8,29

No Rapid Charging, so a 24kWh battery is going to make it short range commuter or shopping trolley. What about maintenance or repairs given it's a US spec. If it stops working during someone's weekly commute, what is going to be the timeframe to get a repair quoted for, nevermind fixed. Will insurance be limited to specialists, given the modifications/import status. 
 
In the same way that i3s is thinking, it will appeal to a car fan who wants to own something unusual. I wonder if it will back back on the market in 12 months. If I was looking for a similar size EV, I'd be doing the same as i3s and getting the eUP on a lease which has a full UK warranty, rapid charging and longer range. Or buy a 22kWh Zoe.

"Just joined this forum. I live in Oregon, USA, where I bought a used (3-year lease turn-in) 500e in January. Absolutely love the car. I can drive all over the metro area and in a month with a lot of driving it costs me as much as $6 in electricity. Very zippy little car and great for city parking. The only downside is the low front, which routinely scrapes going in and out of driveways. I can see why this is the best selling used EV right now. As wholesalers buy them up and ship them to used car dealers outside California, they may become more readily available. If so, I recommend them!",2017,10,13

"There are a few that have been brought over from the states to Italy. A car sharing scheme in Turin (I think) has a few. 
 
The high cost of import is less of an issue here as used car prices are so much higher. While you can pick up an early leaf for £7k in Britain, it would cost me €5k just to get a 1990 Fiat Panda Elettra with 2 seats, lead batteries and a range of 35km. 
 
On a wider note, thinking about Fiat and electric vehicles, you have to consider that Fiat sell over half of their annual European production in Italy, so unless something works in Italy they are unlikely to do it. Here are a couple of the reasons why the spread of electric cars in Italy is going to be difficult without some changes at a national level. Firstly, power limits. In Italy we can't just use as much power as our main fuse can take at any moment and be charged for it, we have to choose a limit (3kW, 4.5 kW, or 6kW) and the standing charge jumps for those requesting a higher limit. From this you'll see that having a domestic 6.6kW charger is not possible as you are already over the highest limit, so you are left with 3.3kW, which is unattractive to many. Secondly, electricity prices are much higher here than other parts of Europe. It would cost me €8 to charge a 24kWh battery from 0 - 100%, and that is more than it costs for the equivalent distance worth of petrol in our Punto. So, unless you really want to, and there are some (but not many) people that do want to, there is no economic case for the switch yet, and until there is then people won't switch and Fiat won't spend money building cars that they can't sell at home regardless of the views of their boss.",2017,10,18
"If electricity prices are so high in Sicily then that is where the problem lies, and is where the people should be focussed on forcing change. That is, of course, unless someone is being made 'an offer they can't refuse', to keep things as they are.  
 
In a place with a great sunshine record the answer could be for everyone to install PV. Payback times would be short due to the mains price. Coupled with home battery storage then local EV transport would be very economical.",2017,10,18
You make some good points but I don't want to turn the thread into a discussion about Italian politics. I was just trying to point out that Fiat's lack of enthusiasm is due to more than Marchionne.,2017,10,18
"Hopefully when Mercedes starts competing in Formula E, Ferrari will have a change of heart and go head to toe with them in the 2019/20 season. Then maybe the 500e will finally have its day in the sun and Italy will change its opinion of EV's and all the necessary incentives to get them accepted... ",2017,10,18
"If you are thinking of importing one, I'd first have a word with your local Fiat garage. 
You don't want to get it, and go there with a problem and they say there's no way they are looking at it, as they don't have any manuals, diagrams tools etc, training , for the HV system.....  
 
But I too wish they'd sell one in the UK as a Zoe / eUp rival .... I'm sure it would go down well in the Nordics and low countries.",2017,10,20
"You can add me to the list of 500 owners who would've happily traded in their 500 for an ""e"" here in the UK! I have owned nothing but FIATs and Alfas all my life. The 500 with an electric motor must be such a joy to zip about in! It has always been a great city car, so electrification would seem to be the obvious next step in its evolution. Its great to hear that they are still going strong after 3 yrs too. Bodes well.  
 
Real shame we cant get any in Europe. Instead, next week, (hopefully) I am driving my current 500L Diesel over to BMW, where it is being part-exed for a brand new BMW i3 94ah rex.

The California ARB rules were written to force a minimum number of clean air vehicles to be produced so that the manufacturer can sell ""regular"" cars in the state, Fiat could have skipped the Fiat 500e AND the California market altogether. 
 
I know that there is an alliance between Renault and Nissan, but there is a reason why Renault isn't selling cars in the US (aside from the fact that I only remember ""Le Car"" as the only Renaults to be sold around here from decades ago.)

"How to make this review short. Fiat have a Winner on their hands! 
I am in the process of looking for a replacement EV for my BMW i3 94Ah (33kW) Rex which has just gone 4 years old and now on 57,000 miles. I have been looking at and testing ideally long range EVs the past few days, as there are now a few about (Kona, Tesla M3, ID3 etc) but this car has caught my eye! I love a small car and the 500 shape has been around for a few years now. Invited to drive this and luckily for me the dealership here in South Wales had both coupe and convertible La Prima editions but only the convertible was ready for a test drive, which would not be my first choice,as the coupe has a lovely panoramic but non opening sunroof anyway. But also lucky as it was a stunningly beautiful sunny day today. 
The design of this car is already a classic based as it is on the tiny original. Modernised and now even more smoothed off as an EV. Proportions almost perfect. What really has surprised me and my wife today was the solidity and cabin quality, style and use and mix of cabin materials though. In a Fiat small car at that. I am familiar with the Abarth 500 but this e version is a big step up quality wise. Really clear and colourful drivers display with plenty of available information and the central display large, clear and colourful in a horizontal format. But also highly responsive as a touch screen. Not laggy like a lot of touch screens. Another surprise. Wireless Apple Car Play (and Android Auto as far as I know) standard on this model. Not sure about other models in the range. 
Lovely light coloured leather seat. Could be even more bolstered but still comfortable. Lovely to hold leather 2 spoke 2 tone steering wheel. Physical buttons on wheel to control menus on drives display. Rear mounted steering wheel push buttons to control entertainment volume and source etc.  
Nice and clearly marked push button dashboard mounted drive buttons for P,R,N,D. Proper physical ventilation buttons/switches above that! Praise be! Wireless charging mat for phones in between the 2 sections. Accommodated my iPhone 12 Pro Max no  problem.USB socket on dash and in central storage cubby. Also deep storage under central armrest. Marketed as a 2+2 of course but very tight in the back seats. A 2+0!? For storage or for small children or short distance emergency passenger lifts only. The coupe seats fold flat 50:50 but did not check the convertible but boot very very small and no major under boot storage- just puncture repair and 3 pin charge cable space really. No frunk. 
 
Now for the driving. Even more impressed. Again that feeling of solidity. Super smooth ride on dual carriageway. Can be firmish over broken tarmac but mainly due to the short wheelbase. Has a firmish edge to it but controlled/very well damped. Dealt with numeorus speed bumps with no crashing or thumping at all. Another surprise. Took them with ease smoothly and softly. 
This car is FUN to drive. Really holds the road well. Fast, direct and responsive steering. Not much feel but par for the course nowadays. It has that thing called ""character!"". If it was a dog it would be a terrier! Have no idea how powerful it is but is fast enough. Not i3 fast but fun and fast enough. Accelerates with ease, and passes other traffic easily. Typical of an EV. 
 
And then there is the roof on the convertible. Certainly aware of more wind noise above your head when closed (Would like to compare with the coupe at some point). Individual ceiling mounted buttons to open - in 2 stages. Seems to open and close at any speed. We did at 40+mph. Not sure if there is a speed limit on its function. 1st press opens to a very large sunroof. 2nd press of same button folds canvas roof to back of car. Obscures rear vision mostly in that position. With windows open it does give the full convertible feel even though roof rails/structure still up and in place. Would have been nice to have some sort on inner sun mesh screen but I guess this would have been impossible design wise, as sun was blinding and harsh feeling on top of our heads at 2pm this afternoon. It is the only new convertible EV available as far as I know, so worth it! (excluding original and forthcoming Tesla roadster) 
3 drive modes activated by a lever type switch between the seats. Normal, Range and Sherpa. Range does give you some re-gen effect which is very welcome but not 1 pedal driving as far as I could tell. Was having too much fun to test that. 
Did not drive economically. Could you tell? Re-set dash trip meter at beginning and set to efficiency page. Covered 15 miles which included a mountain. Started on 83%. Back to dealership with 72%. 40 min drive but at least 10 mins fiddling with info screens and setting seats and mirrors etc. Average consumption 15.0kWh/100km. Not familiar with that combination of units but google seems to suggest 4.14mi/kWh. Warm day-16-18 degC/dry. Impressed with that as had it on Normal mode for most of drive. I think this has a 45kWh battery but as is often the way I am not sure if that is gross or net. Either way this is an impressive car. If we say it has a 40kWh battery then 150-160 mile real world range. I think Fiat have quoted a WLTP range of up to 199 miles? Driven more sedately nearer 200 miles should be possible but this is a type of car that does not necessarily encourage that! 
Will hopefully get to try the coupe at some point. I gather they charge at 85kW. Once the charging infrastructure improves (I have been saying the same thing every year!), then it will be a no brainer to buy and run one of these. (Perceived) High quality little car. Small battery but big enough for urban trips and fast enough charging to do a longish trip. With the convertible roof it makes any trip an event. Especially on a sunny day. Would be good to try it in heavy rain. Noise? Insulation from the elements? Leaks? Perhaps present 500 convertible owners can advise. 
Anyway this is a very welcome addition to the EV market, which is expanding almost daily at present. Fiat has definitely got its **** back. Or hit the EV target with this one.  
And they were offering discounts and good finance deals back at the dealership. APR was 5.?%  
 
As I have ended another review of a car I tested this week, on another part of the forum: this is my opinion of the car I test drove. Your opinion may differ.

And it had a normal sized and useable glove box. Not massive but not full of a fuse box as far as I could tell! 
 
Have now read up on Fiat website and they do say you can do 1 pedal driving so please try this for me. I drove mostly in the default Normal Mode but there was definite re-gen in Range Mode, but did not try it around town in that mode. This should be a feature of all EVs -1 pedal driving as helps to charge battery and improves range. e-208 has minimal re-gen and ID3 also did not regen much in its equivalent ""B"" mode.",2021,4,25
You can definitely one pedal drive in range mode. I tried it on my test drive and it worked well. It’ll bring you down to a standstill and then engage the auto hold - just like a Tesla Model 3.,2021,4,25
Did you find the start up chimes/sound and low speed sounds to be irritating? Or aren’t they that noticeable?,2021,4,25
Not noticeable. We could just about hear the operatic type music/VESS but short lived. Would have to hear it from outside the car I think.,2021,4,25
"Just drove the Mini e on Saturday and was very impressed, but I think we really like the look of the 500. Have you driven the Mini e and could you compare ? Price wise they are pretty similar, but the extra range makes a big difference.",2021,4,26
Thanks for the review. I will be very interested in this in the future probably. Love a small car and lucky enough for it to work for me for now ,2021,4,26
"Very informative breakdown, thanks. My wife is looking for a small car, as we already have a ZOE, but she is starting to gravitate towards the ID3. We've got a few more test drive to do first. Mini e, ID3, Honda E (only cause I want to have a go in it) and the Fiat. Might look at the 208 too.",2021,4,27
"What's the delivery lead time on the 500e? What are the seats like in it? The ones in the Honda E were quite firm.  
 
Even though I know the Honda E will not fit into my life at all I'm still wanting to find ways I can have one. It's a beguiling git.",2021,4,27
"We've just had our test drive and I have to agree with everything  @MarkyM  said. The thing that stuck out the most for me was the infotainment system, very slick and crystal clear. I think I would choose the maps over the Apple ones on Car Play. The wind noise is apparent but then that's driving a convertible car. We even managed to activate the roof at 50mph!! The car drives beautifully and is very much like our current Fiat 500 (but without the 57k miles), firm and sure footed. The acceleration is nippy and the speed is more than acceptable for a quick dash down the M1. Couldn’t quite get the ACC and LKA to work properly but then we were both pressing and guessing. The seats are firm and much like the 500 that we have although I thought there was supposed to be more adjustment but couldn’t see it. Lead times……we’re told that our car isn’t made yet but then the salesman tried to explain how a vehicle production line works and that the car was probably in a layby bit waiting for the winter pack or something. His words not mine! I suspect we’ll get a call in the next couple of weeks… 
 
Like most we haven’t had much to smile about lately but Mrs M cracked a massive smile when the roof went back and she sped off. Really looking forward to owning this car.",2021,4,27
Looks like the 500e is doing the rounds of all the UK motoring press at the moment as all have reviews up online. Good reviews across the board including for the small battery version. It is a light and compact EV. And they seems to agree that it seems quite efficient. Will have to see if Bjorn Nyland gets one on test to see what the real world range is like.,2021,5,21
"Hi -  
 
Question is as per the subject - which of the popular EVs at the moment has what they call ""one pedal driving"" - from what I gather this means that you can set the regenerative braking to such a level that the car will completely stop on its own if you are driving smoothly and anticipating the stopping distances correctly? 
 
Also - does this mean the brake lights come on automatically when you have this enabled as soon as you take your foot off the accelerator?",2022,2,1
"The Leafs have a 1 pedal mode which works very well and you do realise that this mode on all EVs also uses the friction brakes to stop the car. Regen braking can only slow it. 
 
Brake light illumination depends on the rate of retardation and this means both on non 1 pedal and 1 pedal modes. 
On my 62kw Leaf they came on when the regeneration exceeded about 75%.",2022,2,1
"AFAIK, all EVs have regen braking, at least I've not driven one that doesn't. It's more powerful in some than others, some have variable regen settings and some will limit regen when the battery is cold, or fully charged. 
 
All cars are required to have brake lights that come on at a set deceleration rate now, I believe. This means that if regen is high then the brake lights will come on at about the same point that they would if the friction brakes were slowing the car.",2022,2,1
Just curious - some reviews I’ve seen talk about paddles or buttons to adjust the regen. Do they usually remember that setting so you can set and forget? In my Tesla it just has the one mode so there isn’t anything to change so wondered how other cars do it,2022,2,1
Leafs have a switch for e-Pedal so it's on all the time. Cars like the EV6/Ioniq 5 have their own I-Pedal but it needs to be set every time ,2022,2,1
"Hyundai / Kia have 4 regen levels, from coasting (0) to serious deceleration (3). One pedal driving is possible in 95% of the time, only thing is you can't come to a full stop by just lifting the accelerator. You either need to press the brake pedal or pull the left paddle as from 6 km/h or so",2022,2,1
Honda E has one pedal mode. Don't know whether it saves the setting between powering off and back on.,2022,2,1
"Fiat 500e has one pedal driving mode, rarely need to touch the brake pedal at all, once you get used to it. The regen level is preset, no adjustment possible ( not that I have found in the settings anyway)",2022,2,1
"Every modern EV has regenerative braking. 
 
Most but not all can be adjusted in how aggressive that regen is. The Ioniq 5 has four levels as an example. 
 
This is usually done by flicking a button but in some fancier cars flappy paddle. 
 
Some cars will remember the setting, some will go back to a default eg 1(min), 2, 3(max) and defaults back to 2. 
 
Some cars the regen will bring the car to a complete halt whilst others will bring it down to crawling at <5mph and you'll need to put your foot on the brake to actually bring it to a stop.",2022,2,1
Does the auto-hold use the friction brakes when using max gen and coming close to a halt or does it only engage the friction brakes once you come to a stop ?,2022,2,1
"The Enyaq (and I presume the ID3 and ID4) doesn't have 1 pedal. It has regen (and auto regen as you near roundabouts and junctions etc), and it has auto-hold but you still need the foot brake to stop before the auto-hold engages.",2022,2,1
"Isn't it just the Leaf that has true one pedal driving?.. Perhaps the latest Kia/Hyundai do too but I think a lot of cars have a strong regen mode that gets called ""one pedal"". I've heard the Zoe B mode referred to as ""one pedal driving"" which it absolutely isn't.  
 
On our e-Niro in level 3 regen, or the Zoe in B-Mode you can do most of your driving without touching the brake pedal. However when actually needing to stop, the brake pedal is required. Both cars creep like a traditional automatic. It's notable the regen on the Kia is much 'stronger' than the Zoe and it always takes me a moment to re-adjust when swapping between them, so not all cars will feel the same. 
 
I haven't driven a Leaf but my work did try a Kangoo EV demonstrator with one pedal mode and I loved it. No creep, came to a standstill by automatically, gently, applying the friction brakes. Showed the brake lights as you'd expect. Really what all EVs should have and I find it baffling that they don't.",2022,2,1
"The Leafs E-pedal is indeed a true 1pedal mode because the accelerator will apply the brakes to add to the regen if you lift off completely. I.e. the friction brakes are not just used to stop you completely. 
 
(It's easy to compare max retardation, foot off, in B with 1-pedal - there's a big difference due to the friction brakes) 
I used e-pedal most of the time because locally, I had to either slow down to <10mph or stop at a junction and using B would have also required foot on the brake pedal.",2022,2,1
"Dort had 500e 3 months now and energy in is working out at 3.12 kWh/mile but costs low combined with a few free PodPoints and overnight tariff works out at 1.8p/mile so overall PCP and running costs favour EV over a new petrol Fiat 500. Basically if you spend over £100/month on petrol and range is enough (160 miles) then 500e should be 1st choice for Fiat fans.

"Hi all, 
 
So I have a Kona and love it, the other half loves driving the Kona because of the electric, but doesn’t want one as it’s to big 😅 we were considering a Zoe (she has a Mazda 2 at the moment) but really like the style and quirkyness of the Fiat 500e! 
 
It’ll be a 2nd car so it’s not doing long journeys, but what’s the backseats like for kids? YouTube reviews seem a bit mixed with some people saying it’s fine and others not. We have a 5 year old (in a high back booster) and a 12 year old, but realistically 90% of the time the 12 year old would be in the passenger seat and just the 5 year old in the back (there might be the rare occasion where one of them has a friend in the car as well but that’s a really specific circumstance not the norm). If it was all 4 of us we’d be using my Kona, but for when the other half is doing school runs and the odd trip to town etc, what’s peoples thoughts on the 500e? Anyone here have kids and use the back seats? How do they find it 
 
I do totally understand, the Zoe is going to be more practical… but the 500e is a characterful little car! 
 
Thanks!",2022,3,26
Id go Fiat 500e or ID.3 if the back seats aren't big enough.,2022,3,26

"We have a 500e and and ID3 (and a M3LR) 
 
The back seats of the 500e have never been used and probably never will be - a thoroughly unpleasant place to be, even for youngsters, IMHO. 
 
Even setting that aside, I'd imagine that manoeuvring a reluctant child into, and out of, a child seat will be a recipe for back trouble! 
 
The 'internet' will as ever give a range of views on this, in your position I'd take a trip along to a local Fiat dealership with children and car seat in tow and see what you think.",2022,3,28
"I'm 5'10"" & although we only use the back with our 2.5y old granddaughter in a child seat I did try an experiment soon after my wife got the 500e... 
 
 I sat in the passenger seat and moved it forward until my knees were very close to the glovebox but not touching. 
 I then moved to the back and although my legs needed to be splayed I could have managed a short journey of 10-15 minutes OK. 
 The drivers seat remained in its normal position (wife's seating) and was actually further forward than the passenger seat throughout so I'm pretty confident that this would be OK for school runs with kids as described.

"Hey so ordered a fiat 500e icon, I can't afford a home wall box for the moment as they are expensive for me, I do not drive far, so planned on using local fast chargers every now and again and Did plan on using the granny cable for a bit of top up over night which all would do me untill I can afford a wall box. 
 
But just messaged lease company to ask what cables come and said just the type 2 which you use for wall boxes and public chargers where you use your own cable. 
 
No granny charger they said ..how much are these and can you get any as long as it's the correct end? 
 
I have a feeling they are expensive :/ shame I could not get one for free like other cars...I may have to do without if they are alot",2022,2,4
"I can second the recommendation of the Masterplug ones at Screwfix. They do both 5m and 10m ones. As long as you get a Type 2 connector on it, it will work just fine. I personally have a 10m one from there and it's working just fine.",2022,2,4
"As above, the Masterplug one sold by Screwfix is good value. I'd urge caution if using the portable charge point regularly though, as they are really intended as a ""get out of jail"" charging method, when a safer method just isn't available. 
 
There are two potential issues with using one, the main one being that, unless the wiring and outlet is in good condition the plug may over heat. It's a fairly common issue with older wiring installations, so much so that many charge points now have temperature sensors in the plug to turn the charge point off if the plug over heats. The second issue is that a normal outlet most probably won't have the electrical safety protection that's needed to charge a car. There is a small risk that if there is an open PEN fault on the local distribution network then the car body could become live when plugged in. It's a small risk, though, there are only around 500 of these faults across the UK each year. 
 
OK to use very occassionally, if you understand the possible risk, but I'd suggest that it wouldn't be sensible to use a portable charge point every night for months on end, as the more one is used the greater the chance of there being an issue.",2022,2,4
"Anyone got one of those Screwfix granny chargers and know if you can set the charge rate, eg select 4A, 6A or 8A as well as 10A? 
 
I‘m thinking of a granny charger that can do this as a “poor man’s Zappi”. With 6.2kW of solar there are far more days where the car could be charged if the draw could be reduced to say 6A. 
 
My dad does this with his solar as his 2020 Soul EV granny charger lets you reduce to various rates. By contrast my Soul 2018 only has one setting of 10A.",2022,2,4

"Hi All, 
 
I was thinking about the use of Heat pumps in EV's yesterday and something occurred to me. 
 
A heat pump is a great idea for reducing energy consumption of the heater - a COP (coefficient of performance) of 3 to 4 is typical for a heat pump, at least when the outside temperature is above about -10C. This means you get about 3 to 4 times the heat output compared to electrical input. 
 
So a resistance heater (like the one in my Ion) which is 5kW when going flat out uses 5kW of energy, a heat pump could produce 5kW of heat from as little as 1250 - 1600 Watts, which is a major win. 
 
Of course there are drawbacks too - a resistance heater is simple and bullet proof, while a heat pump is just an A/C system going in reverse so has all the same failure mechanisms - such as failing compressor, gas leaks, potential damage to the evap/condensor from road debris etc... 
 
Also below about -10C they get less and less effective and may need the assistance of a resistance heater at very low (Canadian winter) temperatures, although probably not a big issue here in the UK. These trade-offs are well known, but another one occurred to me: 
 
How do you defog the windscreen effectively in really wet/humid conditions around 5-12 degrees if you can't run both the heater and A/C at the same time ? In a conventional ICE or an EV with a resistance heater you can run both heater and A/C at the same time - the air first passes through the AC and is cooled, removing moisture and then passes through the heater to be warmed up again, resulting in warm, dry air that will remove even the worst fog like a magic wand. 
 
Although it saps the battery badly I sometimes find myself forced to run the A/C and heater together (on low) in my Ion to keep the windows clear of fog, and of course its second nature to do this in my ICE where the heater is ""free"" and A/C has little effect on range. 
 
But if you have a heat pump system in your EV do you just have a single dual purpose evaporator/condenser behind the dashboard that switches roles (by reversing the pump) depending on whether you want heating or cooling ? In which case it is impossible to both cool (to remove moisture) the airflow and then heat it up again at the same time ? 
 
Or is there an ancillary resistance heater that you can turn on at the same time that the heat pump is in A/C mode, but at great energy expense ? 
 
I'm interested to know how you find defogging your windows if you have a car with a heat pump system and whether there is indeed a range sapping ancillary resistance heater that needs to be put into action to both cool and heat at the same time... or whether you just find it more difficult to defog your windows in wet, humid conditions...",2017,6,30
"In Defog mode (not shown) air goes through both the evaporator and the inner condenser.

"When I checked a few years ago for the UK it was about £1300 port-to-port ro-ro. The car must be drivable. Otherwise you'd need to use a container which is much more expensive.  
 
Door-to-port added a lot to the price. It will be cheaper if you can find someone to drive the car to the port. Flying there and driving it to the port  might  be cheaper but don't forget insurance. It is easier for me because I'm a US citizen and kept special ""touring insurance"" that covers me driving in the US for short periods of time.  
 
Also most car dealers won't know how to handle export paperwork. You may end up having to pay California sales tax and and DMV fees even though the car isn't staying there. 
 
 
In the UK we have to pay 20% VAT and import duty within 14 days of the car arriving at the port. After that we have to get vehicle approval (IVA) before the car can be registered for on-road use.

We have a Leaf, and a PHEV - Golf GTE 
 
The golf is my daily drive, and my commute is mainly EV - but I have the long range ready for when I need to make a trip ""Up North"" (I was brought up in York, but now live down in Devon) 
 
Charge at home and fill up when you can is my motto 
 
Destination charging is great, because a PHEV has a relatively small battery. I charge in public car parks in Plymouth and Exeter when shopping - I think York has good availability of charge points 
 
Have a look at Plugshare to see where there are chargers 
 
Like the golf the i8 has no ""Rapid"" charge point, but you will be able to plug into an Electric Highway Rapid using the AC plug - but it will only charge at your normal rate. If there is no one using the rapid, then I plug in, to get as many EV miles as I can. If somebody in a BEV needs the charger then I would immediately move - but so far no queues! I use chargebump and leave my number on the dash.

* Model S test drive: Yes I did - it's a great drag car but lacks the tactility, feedback and balance of the i8. I'll do a proper post on why I chose the i8 over the MS when I get a chance - they are very, very different propositions. 
 
* Full BEV i8. Not sure on that one, it's a nice idea but I suspect weight, range, customer acceptance and dimensions precluded it. 
 
* I've got a whole new planning/infrastruture/App thing to learn. I'm looking forward to it

Having said that, the i8 is an exception to the rule if you buy it for performance and not economy. ICE + electric does make for an intoxicating performance car.

"I test drove the ampera for the whole f the Easter weekend last year and fell in love with it - baring the the constant scraping of the front bumper on the slightest bump on the road. But as they are no longer available I had to look at some thing else for my company car.  
As some of the others I too am home based for work but need the ability to drive to Leeds from Portsmouth for work and a regular 200 mile round trip across to Yeovil. But as most of my travel is around town a phev suits me.

Given the choice I'd go for the i8 any day of the week if I didn't have a load of kids and clobber to carry about. Just look at it! In fact, I'd go for an i8 and a cheap small ICE estate for family duties.  
 
Like many others, I've gone for the Golf GTE because it's the best compromise for me right now. It certainly isn't a cop out - it's a choice of something like this or a diesel for my current usage profile. Hopefully it will be the last time I need an ICE in a company car.

I expect the i8 wil do mid 30s fuel consumption when used on longer outings to my daughters place in Whitby, or with friends in West Waless and the Highlands. It may do better on our European tour of France/Germany/Switzerland/Italy. 
 
That may not sound brilliant but: 
 
1. My current car is a C63 Merc. It never does more than 20mpg and is usually closer to 15. My previous car was an Aston V8 Vartage and that was similar. Over 30 mpg is not something I've seen in one of my cars for a long time. And I don't buy the ""PHEV have big ICE"", the BMW has a 1.5litre engine vs my current car iat 6.3 litres. All this is a step in the right direction. Surely? 
 
2. Some of places I go to would be quite a challenge for 95% of BEVs. Range anxiety would be a real issue and I'd struggle to explain why after spending 100k on a low emission car I had to go and rent a smoky diesel saloon to visit the kids, or friends. 
 
3. Over half of my journeys are less than 20 miles. These would be largely electric miles, even on the motorway as the car can do 75 in electric mode. 
 
4. I don't need or really want a 5 door, 5 seat saloon and I enjoy driving dynamics. Yes, I wish the BMW could do 50 miles on leccy only but I don't want to wait the 5 years it will take for a model to appear. The Honda NSX might have been a contender by customer shipments are still a long way off.",2016,1,30

"The PSA Peugeot / Citroen forum is incorrectly titled and poorly organised. 
 
With your help, we'd like to fix that. 
 
Stellantis brands are Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, RAM, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. 
 
Stellantis are rapidly becoming a major BEV manufacturer. Fiat will be an EV only brand in Europe by 2026. That is full BEVs, not hybrids. 
 
 
 
I have several ideas on how to fix the Stellantis area: 
 
1 - Each and every model gets a unique sub-forum. That would be 
 
 DS 3 E-Tense 
 Corsa-E 
 e-208 
 e-2008 
 Ë-Berlingo passenger van 
 Ë-Berlingo cargo van. (there are differences between the passenger and commercials) 
 Ë-C4 
 Ë-Space Tourer passenger van 
 Ami 
 Ë-Dispatch 
 Ë-Relay 
 e-Rifter (Peugeot) 
 e-Partner 
 e-Expert 
 e-Boxer 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Anything I forgot 
 This will get longer as the new models come out. There are Jeep, Dodge and Maserati and RAM EVs on the way in the next two years. 
 
2. As above, but we group all the vans together. Not ideal, as some of the vans are quite different,. 
3. As above, but we group similar vans together (e-Rifter / e-Partner / e-Berlingo) for example. 
 
4. Group cars and vans on the same body together. Vehicles on the same body are mechanically identical to each other. The differences are in trim and specification. 
 
That would look like this 
 
 
 Citroën Ë-C4, Peugeot e-2008, DS 3 E-Tense, Opel/Vauxhall Mokka-e 
 Opel/Vauxhall Corsa-e, Peugeot e208 
 New Fiat 500 Electric 
 Ami 
 Ë-Berlingo / e-Partner / e-Rifter 
 Dispatch / Expert 
 Relay / Boxer 
 The American brands would get similar groupings when the cars are out.

Fixed.,2022,3,21
"Group cars and vans on the same body together would be the most sensible I think. Otherwise I'd think it would get out of hand very quickly. 
 
It also highlights common vehicles with common underpinnings which quite often have the same issues. Much easier to see at a glance when a new herd of 'why does my X do this' where X is the same actual car but with a different jacket on.",2022,3,21
"Yep, group by floor pan. 
 
Bear in mind the unintended consequences of that logic; you should also regroup VAG products, and likewise HKMC. 
 
(I always thought we should, really...) 
 
It makes perfect sense because both hardware and software are common features/faults, and if the forum is aiming to be a relevant technical resource, then failing to group Audi with Skoda (say) is just badge discrimination of no meaningful benefit.",2022,3,21
"Clearly no effort has been made to group other sibling manufacturers cars together so picking on stellantis is wrong for more reasons than one might think. 
Treat these vehicles the same as everything else. 
From the perspective of what I drive this would mean having a Vauxhall forum with sub forums for Mokka and another for Corsa etc. 
Vans should be treated however they already are. 
Similar for Peugeot and Citroën 
The stellantis name shouldn't even come into it. 
 
Clearly if someone has an issue with a pug 208 and the issue might also relate to a corsa they can search appropriately. 
 
By grouping things together it makes things a lot less clear and more difficult and for no reasonable benefit. 
 
Another example is where posts that should have gone straight into the mokka forum were in random places because the poster could not locate the correct place. 
 
The issue is the amount of work to do initially but once organised correctly the only extra work to do is add a new sub forum for a new car. 
 
Of course, you might want to group opel with vauxhall but that is clearly sensible.

Once the Stellantis forum is organised there is no reason not to group others similarly either. It's all been a mess for a long time.,2022,3,21
"Yeah --- 
 
I fall into the engineer group that drives the car, and couldn't care less about the badge.  
 
Before the internet, I would take things apart, including my brand new cars just to see how they were put together. Now I can google it and let someone else take the risk. 
 
The Munro live videos are influencing my upcoming car decision. I've already removed one car from the long list because I don't like the engineering decisions.",2022,3,21
Which is why I posted this survey instead of just asking the admin team to make the change.,2022,3,21
"I think grouping cars by body makes sense on a forum more devoted to DIY repairs, in depth technical analysis and stuff like that. It will likely make more sense when the cars are older as well. 
 
I think this forum, these days is more about the consumer side where people will take their cars to garages, often dealers and so it is more appropriate for the cars to be grouped by make and model.  
 
Just because the e-208 and Corsa e share fundamental components, that doesn't matter for customers discussing dealers, discounts and the like nor does it have much to do with servicing and maintenance when they are so new. Having all Vauxhall and Peugeot posts in one forum muddies those discussions considerably.  
 
I originally voted for group cars and vans by body because that makes sense to me as a nerd/more technical person but I have changed to car and vans get separate sub-forums based on responses to this thread and considering the purpose of this forum overall. Also, one big benefit of computers, we can have as many sub-fora as we want! 
 
It's interesting to consider the long term implications for this forum really, when all new cars are EVs this could be a busy place, but I guess people will split off as all the dedicated manufacturer forums will have sub-forums for the EVs. SpeakEV can remain as a manufacturer agnostic place for general discussion of EV motoring in the UK (mostly).",2022,3,21
"This is a consumer led forum - not an engineering one. How many Vauxhall / Citroen / Fiat drivers are even aware of the corporate governance of the owning company? Why should they care? In my view - most people will be looking for the brand and car - and that's how it should be organised. It would be useful to then have a pinned discussion or information note ""that the following cars are similar and you may find useful information here too"".",2022,3,21
"Maybe a 'sticky' somewhere that new entrants arrive at, then, which list all the vehicles that have their own sub-forum and where to find that. (And, indirectly, also showing which models are NOT given a specific forum)

Doing nothing is the worst option. I've come up with a compromise that doesn't make too much work for  @Admin  and me while fixing the worst of the problems.  
 
 
I've asked  @Admin  to  
 
1) Change PSA To Stellantis. PSA no longer exist. 
 
Old Name 
 PSA Peugeot Citroën EV Forum

New Top level Name: 
 
Stellantis: Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat, Vauxhall and Opel 
 
2) Split the Corsa-E and Mokka-E into two sub-forums. 
 
Rename the current one to Corsa-E. Make a new Mokka-E sub-forum. I'll move posts as needed. 
 
3) Create a new Citroën Ami sub-forum in the Stellantis area.",2022,3,23
"A compromise as you say but it does follow the path of having the least amount of work for the admin people so they'll be pleased. 
It still leaves a bit of work to round up all the Vx Pug etc post which went into the general ev section and maybe elsewhere but truly the number of posts are so few it probably doesn't matter. 
The feeling is people looked for Vx etc, didn't find it and moved on rather than posting in the general group. 
After the update people will easily spot what they need to particularly if they realise nothing is in alphabetical order and will look much further down to find Citroën.

4) Add Lexus anywhere you want,2022,3,23
VW gets separate forums by marque and sub forums by model. The same should apply for Stellantis. Anything else is complicated and confusing and implies too much background knowledge for simpletons like me,2022,3,24
"Most regular car buyers - and let’s hope regular car buyers adopt EVs as quickly as possible - have no idea what Stelantis is, or care a jot. Please make the forum as accessible and welcoming as possible and avoid any approach which requires an explainer. Brand, model, alphabetical and comprehensive.

"So we got our first EV, a 30kW Leaf, in 2017. In 2020 we replaced it with a Zoe ZE50 R135 Rapid charge. 
 
It used to be that you could travel along the motorway with no particular issues, if one charger was broken, you'd go to the next one. 
 
But, travelling from Bristol to Ipswich today has taken 8 hours. 
 
These days it seems, with many more people in EVs, there just aren't enough chargers, every one we reached had a queue of people, and if you stay at the services more than 2 hours they want £15. Half the chargers on the M4 are broken it seems. 
 
It's literally at the point of making me think we need a Petrol car again, just for long journeys, because the lack of charging infrastructure makes long EV journeys a massive hassle and really stressful. 
 
Anyone having similar experiences?",2021,10,24
Absolutely 😁👍,2021,10,26
"I truly believe there is already enough rapid chargers (c10,000 ) but they are not necessarily in the right places YET and not reliably working YET.

"I would imagine any sensible (an assumption) owner would make sure they are at 100% before starting any long journey. Therefore the car's range is a factor on whether a charge en-route is needed. It would only be exceptionally long trips ie from South to say Scotland that a charge would be needed. I suspect that even petrol owners would start with a full tank before long journeys. Stopping at MSA's with high fuel prices is probably avoided as much as possible. So it begs the question who are those who are using MSA fuel stops, are they all ultra long journeys or just bad planners.",2021,10,26
"There appear to be 4,919 rapid chargers in the UK, and 20% of miles driven are motorways. There are 158 msa, but including a number of good off motorway chargers, 200. 
This gives an average of 5 chargers to each msa for an equal supply, as there are between 1-3 chargers typically, there is a deficit of 3 chargers to each msa on current provision.",2021,10,26
"I am proud to say that I blocked 8 CCS bays of 175kW chargers today, parked up in front of them, for 6 hours, with a diesel van. 
 
That is probably the most >50kW chargers (excepting Tesla) I have ever seen in one place, to date. And I have seen a few. 
 
They were not yet powered up, so don't start throwing the vegetables at me just yet.   Very impressive, TBH. Looking all in place and ready to be switched on ... probably waiting for either a new electrical supply and/or some greenwash MP to be available to cut the tape and get the credit. 
 
They were at the Shell station southbound A34, 2km just down from the M40 J9. Not a big service area, short entry curve, drive too fast and you'll miss it. Bays nicely placed on the far side of the hardstanding. 
 
Well, I don't know how many we will need, still looks like a h3ll of a lot to me, and we seem to be coming up with similar numbers now, really. Of course, they can be phased in over the next 20 years, because we're not going to hit 100% BEV fleet any time soon. 
 
Interesting times, and it does seem to be happening. But I'm going to be riding this one out for now in the diesel ICE, I don't fancy being a victim of a lagging ramp-up curve.",2021,10,26

"I live with my folks (don't kill me we're all happy with it) and yeah a driveway (and any kind of EV even a bargain basement 22kwh ZOE) is something I could otherwise not dream of. It's only because the older ZOE and battery lease exist, and I jumped in before the used prices got silly, that any EV was really in my reach even in such a privileged position. On the plus side, I dived in almost 4 years ago and the car itself is seemingly worth more than when I bought it. So I've only had to pay battery lease and extended warranty into it (plus the required expensive services) and otherwise owned a car for 4 years for nowt.

""If we had 10 chargers at each of 100 locations, each delivering 30 charges a day (16 hrs in approx 30 min bins) then we'd get 30,000 charges a day, or ~10 million charges pa. If an 'average' usage is 25 charges per year,then that sort of network, properly distributed (some sites will need more than 10, some less) is capable to deliver to a 400,000 EV fleet. Of course, there will be peak and off-peak times, but this is just to size-up the whole idea. ""  
 
Well, we DO now have ~400k cars and we do NOT have 10 chargers per location (though Tesla is shouldering its own load for its own BEVs), so this thread subject should come as no surprise to anyone if they had read my 6 year old post..... ",2021,10,27
"You only have to look at the number of cars in a msa car park and imagine they are all electric (one day they will be, mostly.) When an an EV stops at a msa it is very likely going to be charging, so to a first approximation that will be the number if chargers required.

If this is your car, this what you travel in. 60kWh cars demand twice the mining of minerals to 30kWh cars. These cars are fine for the majority of riding, they just need a charging infrastructure for occasional long journeys. 
 
100 cars charging at 50kW, needs a 5MW power supply, no idea what that looks like.",2021,10,27
"As I said in an earlier post, many here are assuming that the current technology of EV charging will be identical to what we'll be using 10 years from now. And it won't be. We already have the Ioniq 5 and the EV 6 that can charge 80% of their batteries in 18 minutes. It won't stop there. Charging at C4 or C5 rates will likely be common in 10 years and just as likely batteries will sustain that rate until the full 100%. Let's not forget about higher ranges being more common as well. 300 miles is probably going to be standard. Sizing of the charging network will look a whole lot different when we all drive cars that can leave the home / street and go for a full 250 miles at motorway speed, and will then be able to fill up again in 12 minutes, rather than us driving cars that can go for 150 miles and need 45 minutes to reach 80% again.",2021,10,27
"Charging will certainly evolve and change, and if the connectors change again once the manufacturers get bored of CCS, it won't just be us ZOE people whinging

"The problem with increasing battery capacity is that we don't want to increase volume, weight, cost or consumption of precious mineral resources. Newer battery designs improve all of those, but we still have to strike a balance between making batteries bigger (in all the above senses) and providing more chargers on the road systems. You can't solve either problem by assuming limitless resources for the other.",2021,10,28
"Every increasing battery capacities are (mostly) not the answer. Much better to have more efficient cars and reliable ultra-rapid charging. 3 hours or 200 miles at motorway speeds between breaks would be plenty if you can add another 150 miles in 20 minutes while driver and occupants take a comfort break and grab some refreshments. 
 
Very large batteries where full capacity is only used once in a blue moon are not an efficient use of resources. Charging these batteries on 50kW chargers can block that charger for a long time causing delays to other potential users. Nobody needs to occupy a rapid for more than an hour.",2021,10,28
"REx and PHEV owners may become the best customers for charge point companies. 
They won’t be too bothered when they stop and can’t get a charge, but will use and pay for charging if it is available. (Discuss). 
Whereas big BEVs aka 4 wheel drive sheds will just pixs people off by parking over 2 spaces and hog the charger for too long. 
Bigger batteries can generally charge faster in kW but unfortunately they are in big sheds that do few miles per kWh. 
Lots of generalisations, but I’m mourning the loss of the days when there were only Leafs and Zoen and it looked like BEVs would be less damaging than ICE. 
Big BEVs are just greenwash.",2021,10,28

"The National Travel Survey shows that the average car journey lasts 22 minutes. And the average distance travelled for each journey is 9 miles. Whilst MSAs do need more rapids, surely it's a massive increase in destination chargers that needed rather than 720 rapids at each MSA. 
 
 2018 National Travel Survey Factsheets (publishing.service.gov.uk)",2021,10,28
"Yeah, for me having chargers at the places I go would massively reduce the need to ever rapid charge. 
Especially in the leaf, a typical day out with the family might involve an hour's drive somewhere. Given its tiny battery, it almost always then needs charged to get home again. 
Better destination charging would make owning smaller battery cars far less hassle, which is surely a good thing. People don't want to have to stop and charge for half an hour on the way home from a day out, when the journey length is only an hour. 
As a result we've ordered a car with a huge battery instead.",2021,10,29
"There seems to be a real lack of maintenance with chargers too. So many are broken or only serve up a fraction of their advertised power. 
 
We went to Bournemouth yesterday. Very few working rapids and the one I found was hogged by a IPace that had been left over 2 hours sat at 100%. I would have settled for a 7kw ac, but they all seemed to be in private hotel carparks..",2021,10,29
"I've never understood this focus on the number of moving parts, as if that's a major problem. Most people buying new cars only keep them for 3-4 years, they've switched to a new one long before any reliability issues typically occur. The manufacturing has improved so much that most cars reach end of life without issues to the moving parts in the engine. 
 
The moving parts thing is a complete red herring, the world is moving to EVs because of carbon dioxide emissions. If you could make a ICE which ran on a zero carbon fuel which was better than an EV, then we'd be sticking with the ICE and all its extra moving parts.",2021,10,29

"OP the range estimate is not a 'tank level' indicator. It's a how far can I go if I drive it like this indicator. Many years ago I had a first generation range indicator on an XJ40. If I floored the throttle the indicated range on a quarter of a tank of fuel was 5 miles, take my foot off and it would instantly change to 90 miles. The GoM on your 500e is exactly the same just a bit slower to react.",2023,1,29
"yeah you need to understand how the ""GOM"" works... 
 
Different OEMs have taken slightly different approaches to how they display range. Tesla for instance seems to use the range meter as a bit more like a ""fuel tank size"" in that it always shows the same value when the battery is full. It doesnt account for how you drive or weather, it always uses the same fixed theoretical value to display remaining capacity. My old LEAF seemed to pay little heed as to how i drove the car, but did make some adjustments for weather, a warm day might say 100miles and a very cold one might say 70 or 80. In reality i was lucky to get 80 on the best days. The Merc and Enyaq both adjust their range depending on the last few miles driven (i dont know the sampling period exactly, but i would guess the last 10-20miles is used) 
 
Each of these approaches has pros and cons. 
 
If you take the Tesla approach, then you get the issue where the car says you have ""160miles"" of range, you drive 10miles up the road, and you've now only got ""130miles of range"". This gives you warm fuzzies when you get in and it shows 160miles, but makes you worried as the range is disappearing fast. 
 
The last approach seems common amongst ""legacy"" automakers, as thats also how the fuel tank ""range"" estimates work in ICE cars, so i guess it makes sense to keep it consistent. It takes the consumption from the last few miles of driving, and then extrapolates that out to the full battery capacity. If you do that though, fully charged the car might only say ""80miles of range"", which people dont like as they might think their battery is somehow not fully charging, but at least its somewhat more accurate to what you will actually achieve on the road. 
 
If you are doing short journeys and only drive 5 miles in freezing weather, the consumption will be extremely high due to the cabin heat (and possibly battery heating depending on the car).  
 
However if you actually drove a longer distance, the average consumption would be lower, as once the cabin and battery is up to temperature, the use drops off and thus the average falls. 
 
It makes sense so long as you understand whats going on, and how your car displays the figures. 
 
On average i seem to find i have about 25% less range in summer doing my 40mile commute. In summer the car will average around 3mi/kwh. in winter when its cold, ~2.3mi/kwh. I think thats a reasonable starting point/rule of thumb... However lots of very short journeys will likely make that worse.",2023,1,29
"We’ve got the 42kw one also, done just over 16,000 miles and agree that the range is very poor. We picked the car up new and was showing 210 miles range and since then it’s never gone above 161miles, summer or winter. 
 
Real life range in the summer was about 150 max and winter it’s been about 110 average. I’ve tried various things to increase the mileage but no luck. 
 
Another thing I have noticed is how poor the regen is, it very rarely makes any difference on any setting, I think the most it gained was 2 miles down a long steep hill.  
 
And don’t get me started on the false warning messages that keep appearing randomly despite not having automatic braking or high beam control and various others. Dealer said nothing they can do about them and to wait for a software update. I’ve got used to them but wife still gets worried by them.",2023,2,1
Thanks for the  reply.we get less than 80 miles at the moment on a charge.i think the warning messages are due to the windscreen where the camera is does not clear as no warm air to it when setting  off.my other car specifically clears that area on start  up.also get messages saying no audio etc when radio is still working...quite a few electronic gremlins...auto handbrake does not release after a charge but is ok every other time etc  etc.and no heated mirrors on a 29k car (icon)😆,2023,2,1
"The warning messages also are more prevalent when the sun is low in the sky I’ve noticed. 
 
Auto handbrake won’t release if seat belt not on, also when someone gets out of the back seat the seatbelt warning alert chimes on for ages. 
 
We have the red spec and that’s really poor for the price I think. No heated mirrors or blind spot section, and no auto dipping interior mirror, think it would be cheaper for Fiat to have one type of these relatively low cost items.",2023,2,1
"Have you tried, especially in the winter, to pre-heat the cabin before departure whilst being plugged in? This also warms up the battery so when you set off with a 100% battery, all the hard work of getting the car warmed up is taken from the Grid rather than the HV battery.",2023,2,9
"Hello all, 
 
I am the very happy owner of a zippy Fiat 500e, my first EV, wonderful to commute and drop the kids off at school 5 min away. 
 
I settled on keeping my good old and reliable ICE Dodge minivan to pull our motorcycle trailer for week end outings. It really is oversized for this usage and I was thinking of replacing it with a RAV4 EV with a hitch. 
 
But... range and range reduction with the additional constraint of the (relatively light) trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it. I would be lucky to get a total of 60 real miles (guestimate) total for the full equipage, which really puts us right under what is needed to go to the nearest track and back... 
 
But, pulling a trailer means that I can add things onto it, like... extra batteries for the Rav4 EV and may be get to a point where, even with the extra weight, I could extend the range sufficienty for our escapades. 
 
Before getting into efficient frontier calculations (I wil need to research the data first), I wonder if anyone here has experience with adding extra batteries to their EV.    
 
Looking forward to learning. 
 
Thank you, 
E",2017,9,11

"Cripes, imagine if you engaged e-pedal with a full battery and you lifted your foot while approaching a roundabout ......and nothing happened.",2022,2,3
"I think I mentioned this earlier, but I am not at all keen on the Leaf's e-pedal anyway. It does work though. I do wonder how the Kona works when the battery is full. Is there still the same level of regen, or are the friction brakes automatically applied?",2022,2,3
"Emergency stop you will want to hit it unless you have complete faith in the AEB saving your bacon 🙈🤞

"I've never driven the Kona, so no experience with it. In my Chevrolet Bolt, I never touch the brake pedal unless I need to slow faster than regen is accomplishing (it happens sometimes, usually if I wait too late to begin slowing), or coming to a stop on a significant downhill slope. Going uphill is no problem, as the car has a hill hold function. But under 99% of my usual driving conditions I never touch the brake pedal. So that meets the definition of one pedal.  
 
My Niro PHEV would NOT come to a complete stop from regen, as it kicked off at 5 MPH and then coasted. I think the Niro and Kona EVs operate the same, although they do have adjustable levels of regen that my PHEV did not have.",2022,2,3
Just found that Hyundai themselves can't seem to get it right in calling it i-Pedal,2022,2,3
"What this thread really tells you is, if you really want to understand the details of the functions of EVs, get a thorough test drive of three cars on your short list. I would also recommend making the Leaf one of them. It is a very useful benchmark to compare other cars to. 
And that comes from someone who swapped a Leaf for a Lexus EV.",2022,2,4
"The Bolt doesn't require the paddle to come to a stop. Normal regen does that without the need for it or the brake pedal. It simply increased the regen level, and actually does nothing below about 5 MPH. I seldom use it because it's rather abrupt, rather than the smooth increase/decrease that can be accomplished with the brake pedal. But again I rarely have to touch the brake pedal when driving under typical conditions. One Pedal mode provides enough braking/stopping power under almost all conditions.",2022,2,4

"My Ioniq PHEV has variable regen modes I can adjust with the steering wheel paddles. But I wouldn't call it one pedal driving. It's much more for slowing the car when going down hill, the same as you'd do with a manual car putting it in a low gear.",2022,2,5
"Mustang Mach E also has true one-pedal driving, as in when switched on, the car will slow to a complete stop if you take your foot off",2022,2,5
"a good test would be to charge to 100% then get to a relatively high speed like 60mph, then back off. This would generate high kw of regen and that may be more than the battery can take at 100%. Maybe they have a top buffer that can take it for long enough until your battery gets low, or they limit regen, or they use friction brakes. But that would give you an idea I think",2022,2,6
"They should do a carwow test like the 70mph to 0 
 
Take the One-Pedal cars and do a rolling 40mph and simultaneously take their foot off and see which one brings it to a stop the best. 
 
Repeat the test at 100% SoC (for the cars that don't automatically disable One-Pedal and warn you) and see if the friction brakes are used and the stopping distance is identical or longer.",2022,2,6
"I didn’t specify or particularly care how they mechanically do it - point being for ‘cars that can control the friction brakes themselves without driver input’ - it would seem to be logical that they’d try and have a standard retardation when you lift off the throttle - based on speed/slope etc. when regen isn’t 100% possible it can add in friction brakes so you feel no difference 
 
I guess it’s less efficient - better to coast in that scenario to use less energy - but does leave the driver to adapt based on state of charge/battery temperature.",2022,2,6
"In a brake by wire system there's always (at least as of 2022) a fail safe that the brake pedal will cause the brake fluid to get the calipers to grip the pads. 
 
What I'm saying is that is when there is a system failure. Not in normal use. 
 
The brake pedal will be just telling the control unit how much the person's foot is pressed down or released. It's then directly applying the friction brakes (or in the case of EV also deciding if regenerative braking is applied)",2022,2,6

Lol that was funny,2014,6,18
"I've been a diesel driver for years but have hankered after an EV for a few years, doing my research! A family member might want to buy my low mileage 2015 Dacia Duster diesel car, so I'm seriously pondering what to get now. Whilst I love my gadgets I also dig functionality over style, so what some might see as an ugly duckling, is not necessarily ruled out. 
 
If I kept the diesel as a second vehicle I've been seriously tempted by the Twizy as a fun run around but if I'm selling the diesel, I'll need a far more capable vehicle. My only issue is my driveway is barely the length of a car, there's no gate and it's a busy main road (Southampton's very own Piccadilly Circus), where school children walk past every day. This means any car parked on the driveway needs to be reversed on as reversing out into a busy road is a no-go. This also means any electric car cannot have a charge port on the nose, as the darling little feral, pint sized crotch goblins will snap the plug and charge flap whilst walking by, the moment I turn my back! 
 
So, I'm needing a short list of EVs which have  side accessed charging ports.  Budget £15-30k ish. Not that interested in PCP or finance unless I can get a discount then pay it off in full soon after, as I usually own a vehicle until it becomes a liability to keep repaired. New or nearly new / ex demo etc. The ones I can think of right now are: 
 
 
 Peugeot e208 
 Peugeot e2008 
 Vauxhall Corsa -e 
 Vauxhall Mokka -e 
 Citroen E-C4 
 Citroen Berlingo Electric 
 Mini Electric (bit small but it is cute) 
 BMW i3 (do like the styling, but worried BMW aftersales will be costly and painful) 
 VW ID.3 (do I really want to be a software beta tester for what might be Windows ME on Wheels??) 
 VW eUP and the VAG siblings (bit small, only 3kw charging on AC I seem to recall) 
 Skoda Enyaq 
 Smart For-Two / For-Four (excluded as they don't do DC rapid charge) 
  
Tesla, even 2nd hand sub 30k, are off my shortlist as I can't be doing with a company who are so anti right-to-repair and have questionable build quality. 
 
So, what cars have I missed, if any?",2021,7,8
"Forgot about the e-golf. Might be a few ex demo's knocking around still! 
 
Yes, I know Citroen hasn't got the best reputation (French + electrics was historically the butt of many jokes), but if its got manufacturers warranty and a dealer network, you hope you can get by. Same goes for all mainstream car manufacturers really venturing into the EV world. None of them have got it 100% right first time. That said, I've heard too many horror stories about the build quality of Teslas, their customer service ""like it and lump it"" attitude etc. For now, it's off the list.",2021,7,8
"Had my iD3 for a week today. 500 odd miles - not a hitch. Perfect - and a joy to drive.  
I had SW concerns but seems most of those were sorted in the version (2.1) that mine came with.",2021,7,8
"I think I'll have to test drive an ID3 before I make a judgement on it, quality wise. If there are quality issues, I would hope and expect VW to be all over them as they've bet the fortunes of the company on getting their new EV platform right.",2021,7,8
Hyundai Ioniq has a rear nearside port and is about the most efficient EV in your budget if a T is out of it.,2021,7,8
Hyundai Ioniq.,2021,7,8
"If you can fit some of these cars (on your list) by length, then I'm sure the last gen Kia Soul would also fit. The cover pops open sideways, not out, and the actual socket is far enough back that you don't really need that much clearance at the front. I could park with just 6 inches clearance and pop the cover, lean over to insert the plug. You can only lean from one direction though because that flap comes sideways and you need to do this from the other side, it is not central. 
 
I suspect other cars are likewise. You might be over-restricting your list because in fact the actual sockets are usually quite some distance back from the actual cover and the clearance needed is really a matter of inches. There's no need in most cases to be able to actually stand in front of the car to plug one in. YMMV. 
 
Pick the car you want and get a loaner to see if it fits your driveway, before writing it off. 
 
TBH, if you have certain 'demographics' wandering around looking for trouble, to have your plug in lead completely hidden up at the front might actually be what you'd prefer.",2021,7,8
"I always assumed the Hyundai and Kia range were all nose chargers! Good call and I've heard nothing but praise about the EV Ioniq.  
 
Always said it's a shame Dacia don't do an Electric Duster with 150 mile range, 50kW CCS and a sensible sub £20k price ticket to boot. Would sell like hot cakes. Renault might not like that I suppose, not having a more ""premium"" offering to counteract it.",2021,7,8
"When it comes to driveway length, I can just about fit a MK5 Ford Transit SWB on the drive, with the back doorstep touching the bay window brickwork. The risk of a charging plug / flap being damaged pavement side is too high from passers by. I don't think many of them are that callous to go out of their way to damage the cable if it was side entry though as it will be too far up the path for most to bother with.  
 
Also it is simply not safe to reverse onto a busy main road, right next to a junction with a roundabout. Whilst it's a 30MPH zone, many cars are doing that by the time they come off the roundabout and pass my house, doing 40MPH or more a few more yards up the road!  
Also - highway code, rule 201    
 
That said, a neighbour used to reverse off the driveway out into the road every day for years and it was a miracle he never had an accident.",2021,7,8
I think that rule was made before 360 cameras and cross traffic alert ,2021,7,8

"Noticed that quite a few initial reviews of the new electric Fiat 500 are now on Youtube from the German reviewers. 
 
The most interesting one that I came across is linked below (links jumps to charging section), however due to its length the auto generated closed captions aren't available. 
 
Key take aways from the linked video at the 150kW Charger 
 
 Car plugged in at 7% - Initial charge rate of 82kW 
 26 Minutes to 81% - At 81% Charge rate of 42.5kW with 27.7 kWh delivered in that time 
 42/43kW until 85%, seems as though it is a staircase shaped charge curve 
 At 85% charge rate drops to 13kW 
 Around 29 minutes from 7% to 85% - 29.4 kWh delivered in that time

English full length review now available,2020,11,21
"We’re thinking of replacing my wife’s 2011 toyota verso S with an EV as it should suit her low mileage (circa 3k per year). We’re thinking of the fiat 500 electric as the icon 42kWh versions are currently circa £20k used for a 2022 model low mileage (<10k miles). 
 
I thought I’d ask opinions on it and if it’s a good choice.",2023,4,3
"If only 3k miles per year, would a cheaper 24kwh one do? 
That mileage suggests short commutes.",2023,4,3
Make sure you have a drive in a Mini Cooper SE to compare.,2023,4,3
"My sister drove a Renault Zoe for a year with Onto and recently leased a Fiat 500e. She drives mostly alone and says it’s perfect. It’s got 199 miles range which is perfect for around town and a quick trip from London to Brighton. 
 
I’m 6 ft 3 and couldn’t fit in the petrol version as my head kept touching the ceiling. I’m truly surprised with the electric version, even with the seat adjusted high I still had headroom and it was spacey for my long legs. 
 
She charges once a week as she only covers town driving and it costs her £8 with the Elli card/app. Electroverse is good too. 
 
The only drawback with the action and icon models is the halogen headlights (yellow not white led). The LED headlights is on the Prima version and that’s a lot more costly, still covers 199 miles and it’s got a more plush interior.",2023,4,3
e-up? Similar size and probably cheaper,2023,4,4
"Yes I drive one 42kwh version (My wife's car). Fits me a hefty 6ft 4ins. 160m range with ease. Today I got two dining room chairs in the back down to the dump. Lots of room. First EV? Yeah a good contender but do drive a Corsa-e as well. I also have a Mokka-e which on paper looks similar. It isn't. The Mokka makes a comfy Cruiser but the 500e is a good city car. 
I agree about the headlights. Standard ones are insufficient you need the LED version.",2023,4,4
"I have just purchased a 71 plate 500e and wondered if there was an app that allows you to control charging from your phone. 
First post so sorry if it is a bit naive",2023,4,18
Yes there is. Just search for Fiat car in the app store (android) no idea about ios.,2023,4,18
"Thanks, I’ve downloaded uconnect live but I cant connect with the vehicle. 
might have to search YouTube",2023,4,18
You need the app just called Fiat as well as unconnect.,2023,4,18
"When you get the car from new, the dealer sets you up an account with Fiat, so that you can access the app etc. Essentially associating your car with your email address. I'm not sure what happens on a used car, but when owners have had issues with the dealer not setting them up correctly, fiat customer services have resolved it.",2023,4,18
"Found this advisory suggesting import duties won't be an issue: 
 
""If you have owned the vehicle for at least six months and lived outside of the EU for at least one year (185 consecutive days) and are moving back to the UK permanently, then you will not have to pay any import VAT or duty (which is nice.)In order to prove this we will require proof of US residency from at least one year ago, for example a utility bill, bank / mortgage statement and also proof of vehicle ownership from at least six months ago, for example an insurance certificate or title/registration document """,2020,11,19
Since we are considering moving back to the UK - then that would make a lot of sense - we could bring both cars back but the Fiat should be a lot more supportable.... and my wife would not want to drive LHD.,2020,11,19
"While it would be cool to bring across a Fiat 500e, i think the practicalities would make it more hassle than it's worth: 
 
1. As mentioned, insurance might be an issue and could cost a lot. 
2. I believe the vehicle will still need to pass an IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) prior to being registered in the UK - this is more cost and hassle. 
3. Once you have it in the UK, if something goes wrong you might be stuck for quite a while to get parts. 
 
Once you add up all the various expenses, I think you would be better to pick up a second hand Nissan Leaf in the UK - it will probably cost you a lot less in both money and stress!",2020,11,23
"I asked on another thread about what you get in the car.  
 
Looking at the website you get a wall box that is essentially a neater way to use a 3 pin plug ( not bad but not ideal) as our dumb Rolec charger is nearly 6 years old I'm thinking of upgrading however there isn't any costs cited and dealership doesn't have details.  
 
Has anyone enquired? I know 6 years ago my install cost me £249 after the grant. I assume it'll be far more today. Also my concern is whilst 'smart' is neat. Dumb also means the energy providers can't tax use (which Im assuming will be enviable) as it's invisible to them so reluctant to give the Rolec up. 
 
Thoughts?",2021,8,30
"I’d stick with the Rolec. 
 
Ours is also 6 years old and going strong. Just needed an RCBO replacement two years ago.",2021,8,30
"The easywallbox is not that smart it's only bluetooth to the phone app, to start or set a programming schedule and see some stats. I'm thinking of replacing our current charger as it's not tethered. So it should just need the electrician to disconnect the current charger and replace with the new one. No cabling to be done to the boards.",2021,9,7
"In the UK you can get a grant of £350 to have an EV Wallbox installed. This is useful if you want to upgrade to the 7.4kW connection. The chargepoint / wallbox has to be on the government's approved list but despite there fact that here are at least 100 on there, the easyWallbox isn't listed. It's made by an italian company called Free2Move (link below) but they aren't on the list either. The Fiat dealers I have called barely understand the question, let alone have the answer. My easyWallbox is free with the car but if I had to pay for the box I would choose one on the government grant list and shop around for an installer.",2021,9,9
"I swapped out my un-tethred Chargemaster for the new tethered easywall box, and it was fairly simple. Just make sure yout turn the little control knob to position 7, then download the 2nd app ""easywallbox powerup"" app, and change the safety limit to 32a 7.4kw. No issues so far. It's putting in 7KW per hour.",2021,9,21
"Hi There, 
 
My wife bought a Fiat 500e last June and I have to say it is a fantastic car. However, one question I have is.... Fiat claims the car's WLTP range is good for 199 miles but when fully charged the dash says the range is 161 miles! Is there some sort of safety margin here?  
 
This has been like this for some time - so when the weather was warmer. 
 
I wonder if any of you can shed some light on this? 
 
Cheers  
 
Austin",2022,1,18
"'They all do that sir' . Mine is the same and seems all owners experience the same. WLTP figures are just like the claimed MPG in ICE cars - calculated based on a specific test which is not like the real world. But it is very odd that everyone has range of 161 miles at 100% Soc, suggesting the software has adjusted it. Very read some people saw 190 range when they first purchased the car, I don't recall seeing that personally.",2022,1,18
"Okay, thanks. I have a vague recollection of it showing 184 odd when we first got it but as I don't drive it much, I have only noticed the 161 range over the last couple of months.",2022,1,18
"Turn off the climate air con system - including the fan - so everything fully off  
Does it go up a tad ?",2022,1,18
"At the end of the day, the “range showing” is a guess by the car, . 
 
What is the ACTUAL range you are experiencing, eg charge fully and drive it",2022,1,18
"I've posted this before, but it is an illustration as to just how different the true range of all cars, no matter what fuel they use, is from the advertised range. In 2005 I bought a Toyota Prius hybrid, and decided to monitor its performance to see how much more efficient it was when compared to other cars I'd owned. 
 
That car is advertised as having a (extra-urban) range of 668 miles (from the official mpg and the fuel tank capacity). That is a complete joke, the very best I ever managed to get out of it was a range of only 607 miles, and in winter that range dropped massively to only 506 miles. 
 
The thing lost over 160 miles of its advertised range in winter. My wife's Yaris was actually worse, that didn't get as close as the Prius to meeting its advertised range. You will find it's exactly the same for ever other car every sold - the specs never come close to reality. 
 
The issue with EVs is that the range is stated in the WLTP testing, rather than the mpg (which has to be divided into the usable fuel tank capacity to get the range). This means that reviews and advertising for ICE vehicles rarely ever mentions the range. As another example, the first few cars I owned were all Minis. The fuel tank held around 5 gallons and they might manage to get 40mpg if driven carefully. That meant that they had a maximum range of no more than about 200 miles, and in reality the range was a fair bit less than that most of the time.",2022,1,18
"It's a known fault with the car discussed on the Facebook car owners forum at some length.  
 
As others said you'll know or learn to understand the cars range in certain conditions using certain climate controls.  
 
I still think the i3 is the best at guessing compared to the Nissan and 500e",2022,1,18
"The indicated range is a fiction. The max range is essentially the usable battery capacity multiplied by the car’s supposed efficiency. So if you can achieve 4 miles/kWh and have a 42kWh battery with 37.3kWh usable, then the range is 149 miles. 
 
4 miles/kWh is pretty good this time of year and you probably won’t manage that. 3.5 is more realistic, so the range is then 130. 
 
to get 199 miles from 37.3 kWh usable means hitting over 5 miles/kWh which is… optimistic. Then again it’s a city car by design so in summer, with very careful driving, you might manage it. 
 
More realistic is just 4.3miles/kWh which gives you the 161 range. 
 
The more I think about it, have they massively cocked up and stated the car’s range based on the full battery capacity rather than the usable capacity?",2022,1,18
"You need a purpose built EV with a slippery outside shape like a model 3 to exceed 4 miles/kWh in winter. Our e208 is giving about 3.3 m/kWh now and it has a 45kW battery. So 199 miles is fantasy from a 37kW battery. Most we have had in the summer is 170 miles of actual driving (150 motorway plus 20 left at journeys end). Which brings me to my second point, you don't drive the car from full to empty. You probably start with 80% or so and end up with 10 to 15% so your range is already reduced.",2022,1,19
"In many EVs, range in cold weather can be maximised if the cabin and battery are pre-conditioned before departure whilst the car is still connected to an EVSE. As stated above, damp roads and the use of heating; lighting and wipers are a constant battery drain. Cold weather range reduction of 25% is not uncommon in some wet and cold wintry conditions. I have also had days when the GOM range has dropped quickly post departure, only to stabilise and increase as cabin temperature stabilises.",2022,1,19
I found the GOM on the Ioniq (saloon/fastback/not the big boy now being sold) to be pretty accurate.,2022,1,19
"The peculiar thing about the 500 is that once fully charged it always claims a range of 161.6 (don't forget the .6!) miles.  
 
All of the other EV's I've experienced (we have a Tesla Model 3 and a VW ID.3 in the household) at least pretend to play the game and vary the estimated range a little after each charge!",2022,2,16
"Hello all, I am new to the EV world just recently stumbled upon the concept as I was browsing for my next potential vehicle purchase. So as I'm new to the EV scene, I've been doing my research and watching a lot of youtube videos and I've come to settle on a potential buy. The Nissan leaf caught my attention when I was comparing it to a 2017 fiat 500e and a 2016 Volkswagen e-golf. A local dealer has a used 2017 nissan leaf s with around 6,000 miles for around $13,000. Now the whole reason for this post, is this a good price for a first used EV? What was the price of your first EV (including year and make)?",2020,7,7
"Hi 
I'm afraid that this site has mostly UK based contributors, so our prices etc are not going to be relevant for you. Also, we never got the 500e over here. 
To answer your question, my first EV was a battery owned Renault Zoe ZE40 in 2017, and it cost just over £17,000 (brand new). I don't think the US got the Zoe, which is a shame, because it's a good small EV.",2020,7,7
Thanks. Yeah I noticed after I posted that most posters were from the UK. I appreciate the feed back none the less.,2020,7,7
"True we didn't get the 500e but I believe that was a compliance car anyway so you're probably best staying away from that one  . 
 
In terms of second hand pricing both mine were Zoe's too.  
 
First one bought in 2018 was a 2015 22kwh model at around £7-8k

That makes sense and if you're gonna collect cars why not make them nice EVs - by the way I had a good look at the I8 BMW at my local dealer today and it's a fine looking machine. They also told me they had sold 20 I3s and 7 I8s already ( in Canterbury ) which is pretty amazing !,2014,7,31

I've reached a decision on the  i3... It's on my blog . [spoiler alert: we refused delivery.],2014,8,7
"Due to the Corsa really cheesing me off I decide to break the habit of a lifetime and actually test drive a car I was thinking of buying rather than just sitting in it and relying on James & Kate etc reviews. 
 
I expected to be smitten. I wasn't. 
 
The looks are awesome. The stereo is awesome. The concept is awesome. But... 
 
The screens feel too close and the steering wheel doesn't pull out far at all. Seats are very firm. They are well designed and supportive. I was sat too high in the car as well. 
 
The screen mirrors do work really well but if you're a certain age the driver's side one can be just in the area of vision that is in the needs reading glasses distance. I did get used to it but it did make by eyes weird at times. 
 
Ride is also quite firm but it corners flat as anything. Power steering is clever and weights up at higher speeds but it does mean the car sometimes feels weird when you change direction.  
 
Road noise seems quite intrusive in a way I wasn't expecting. It's definitely louder inside than the Corsa. 
 
Turning circle is fantastic. Stereo is so good I almost ignored all the other negatives.  
 
Steering wheel is also kind of sweaty compared to the cheaper feeling Corsa one.  
 
Boot is very shallow which I didn't grasp. I thought it was shallower horizontally but taller (like the Soul EV). It's very shallow in height but a bit longer in depth. I did have the measurements but somehow they didn't translate to my brain.  
 
Range. Hmmm. Did 30 odd miles and it had about 60% battery or so which isn't any good as my usual trip is 55 and all year so it wasn't going to be quite up to it. It was quite efficient at times and once you'd been going for a bit and were bimbling along at 30-40 it did go up quite a bit. Over all was 3.3 miles per kWh on the mixed run. Think the Corsa would have actually done better. With a tiny battery you have to be much more efficient. It needed to have been Kia efficient as I'd reckon one of those would have been about 4 -4.5 miles per kWh doing the same. 
 
One pedal mode is quite good but even on max death the regen feels weaker than I expected. It was weaker feeling than the Corsa which is quite weak. The Leaf had very strong regen in B mode and also with E Pedal. That was neck snapping in comparison. 
 
Other issue was with reversing onto a sloping driveway. It didn't like it. Mine slopes down and it seems to upset quite a few cars. The corsa I just stick in reverse and it creeps in reverse with the brake on happily. I turned off the one pedal in the Honda and it didn't seem to want to creep so you hit the gas, it lurches off you hit the brake and it's at a dead halt so you are making a right hash of a simple thing.  
 
I'm glad a drove one as it's been one of those cars I haven't stopped obsessing over since they came out.",2021,4,25
"Thanks. Saves me trying to convince myself to keep wanting one! 
 
Coould you try the Mini next? ",2021,4,25
Might be worth trying the Fiat 500e too!,2021,4,25
Looking at the Honda Boot and going back to mine has made me realise the Corsa boot is the smallest I could live with. Fiat and Mini boots are both smaller. Mini also seems to not have a heated steering wheel on any trim level or I couldn't find where it was listed.,2021,4,25
"My wife & I felt the same when had test drive last year. Not good enough. I thought the screens poor resolution which was a big disappointment as they dominate the cabin. The drivers screen was much better though.  
poor efficiency and we drove in summer temperatures. 26 degC or so. Got same efficiency as you. Solid feeling and drives well enough but TOO heavy for such a small car which is why efficiency is so poor.  
fantastic turning circle but that is not that much of a selling point overall. No frunk unforgivable in a ground up design EV with a tiny boot! 
And it has just 50kw charging speeds but on release said it was 100 kW capable.  
A colleague pre ordered and owns one. Likes it but purely short distance commuter car. But almost £30k for a short distance commuter car?! Was getting 50-60 mile range this winter. Just not good enough. Same as original Leaf from 2010.  
Lots of YT reviews marvelling at the aquarium on the screens and that you could plug in a kettle In th 3 pin socket. In the real world though, former is a 5 minute wonder/gimmick and the latter much more useful in a bigger batteried EV! With such a minuscule range most owners would be worried about losing even more mileage By plugging in high drain electrical equipment.  
They need to put a slightly bigger battery in it. eg-45kwh to 50kwh and keep the price the same or lower. Will sell better then. Not seen another on the road apart from my colleague’s so I don’t think they have sold that many.",2021,4,25
"I did like the feel of rear wheel drive though. It's much nicer in some ways.  
 
I haven't seen a single one in the wild either. The honda dealer is only a few miles away so I'm surprised I haven't seen more of them pottering about.  
 
The sales person I spoke to was also using one and doing 60 mile return trip with 50 left regularly he said. Mostly dual carriageway as well so I did think it might have been ok.  
 
It was a lot better mannered at 70 than I expected. If they do a mk2 with a bit bigger battery capacity and better sound insulation I might be interested. It's still the sort of car you look back at when you lock it.  
 
I think Tesla Bjorn did a 75 mph test in warm weather and it was 75 miles range I think. Car wow got 110 I think to flat as a fart. Corsa did about 170 so there's quite the jump.",2021,4,25
"If I were to put together a Jay Leno style car collection, but limited to EVs obviously, it’s a car I’d buy. It would have to be green, or maybe white, but it’s a car I love looking at. 
 
I saw a green one on the A1 a few weeks back, made me slow down and have a god look at it. 
 
As a practical daily driver for me though, wouldn’t work, but still an interesting car in its own right.",2021,4,25

I'm not a fast driver by any stretch of the imagination, but this is something else.

"An interesting write up thank you, those LCD mirrors are a bit of a bone of contention within the industry (or were) as all the testing we did fall heavily in your “I need reading glasses” category, it was great for younger engineers but to those of a certain age they were a pain......and this was back in the 90’s, there is no technology that can make the screen appear further away to the brain/eyes and thus sharp. 
 
The same is happening presently with a lot of Land Rover/Range Rover drivers who have the Clearsight RVM complaining of the same issue, but at least the CS RVM can be used as a conventional mirror. 
 
I love the look of the Honda, forward design which shouts EV.",2021,4,25

"@srichards  So it makes you appreciate your Corsa-e a bit more now, huh ?   
 
I'm not saying the Corsa-e is prefect, but IMO it's a good all-rounder... fairly practical if you don't need the extra space in the rear/boot. 
 
I think the Corsa-e's ergonomics are also OK. I can't see myself getting used to something like a Tesla or even an ID.3 with all those touch sensitive buttons and sliders. And I do consider myself a tech geek. 
 
I really don't understand Honda's intentions when they created the E. It just goes to show you that so much tech won't make up for a non-practical car. 
It's nice as a concept car, but really shouldn't have made it to production.",2021,4,25
"It makes me appreciate I shouldn't tolerate the pathetic excuses from Vauxhall for sub standard software as all the functions on the Honda work properly. Bluetooth reconnects correctly. It starts instantly. It was released in a pandemic as well. Blind spot function also seems to work like it should. 
 
Honda has buttons and knobs for quite a few things so it's definitely functionally ok. Heated wheel button is on the heated steering wheel like the Corsa not in some random corner like a lot of other cars.",2021,4,25
"I really like the look of the Honda e, but not driven it yet so this is very useful thanks. Trying to decide what 2nd car to get for the household.",2021,4,26
As a short range second car it'd be ideal really. Especially if it's mostly city driving as the one pedal feature is quite good. You don't even use the brake. It just holds itself when you stop and then off you go again as soon as the traffic moves. It's definitely a better feeling one pedal system than the Leaf one. That's quite soft to go and harsh to stop. The Honda is more uniform but regen isn't as strong.,2021,4,26
The Honda E was great but the Jazz was £8k cheaper and actually has better level 2 autonomy/safety tech (check the NCAP videos) due to a wider angle camera.,2021,4,26
"Interesting read, I'm getting to the point where I need to start thinking about what to replace my lease BMW i3 with in November (lead times etc!) and the Honda E just came back on my radar for some reason. Always loved the design but the range put me off, wanted to go for the Ioniq 5 but availability and no-doubt stratospheric price is ruling that out! 
 
Sadly this thread has convinced me it's probably a non-starter, it's the closest car to the now-ancient i3 really in terms of concept but at 150kg heavier, slower with less power and smaller battery - by the looks of it less efficient to boot! It just seems a real shame they chose the small battery route, doesn't seem to offer the great weight saving the idea was based on, was hoping they'd have been working on a slightly larger version but can't find anything imminent. I could just about live with the even smaller boot but there seem far too many compromises overall, an i3S is currently far cheaper to lease and probably still one of the better small options. Bummer. 
 
*Edit - one other factor with these small battery cars I'm not sure is considered enough - lifespan, Li-ion batteries degrade with number of cycles and when you have to top up twice as often on something like the Honda E vs similar sized Zoe you're likely to experience even more depleted range after a few years, killing used prices too!",2021,6,4
Another i3 is probably the answer  @Jimrod  The electric Corsa is being discounted like mad. It's worth a try but it's not a finished car by any means.,2021,6,4
"Hi, 
With 100% battery remaining mileage is 200miles. When driving in eco and max speed of 60 miles per hour after a drive of 60 miles, battery indicates 50% with remaining mileage of 60 miles. With this indication we never dare to go beyond 120 miles on a full battery. Do you experience the same? And how do you handle? 
Thanks",2022,11,27
"Stellantis GOM is a but silly. When full it's very optimistic and when you start using running the battery down it become very pessimistic 😂 
 
If it works the same as the Corsa when you start running it down it calculates the higher end of the red bar as 0%. In reality that's 12.5%. So probably add another 20 miles on. Obvs depends on style of driving/weather etc. 
 
Don't get too hung up with the GOM, it's a guess, just a very poor one in Stellantis vehicles. Better to look at your consumption and do some quick maths based on 45kwh useable capacity.",2022,11,27
"Look ignore the GOM. For every 10% of battery you need to be doing about 20 miles. If your doing that or get a consumption of 4.4 then your bang on 200 miles.  
 
The other day with no effort on my part and at 65 to 75mph I did 75miles at a consumption of 41% which is a 182 mile range. I stress that was with zero effort and 9deg c outside. I could have easily done far better but I wanted it warm and comfy and didn't need to bother about extending the range.  
I admit being a novice owner concerned by range but after 14 months of ownership I have absolute confidence in my Mokka-e and am thoroughly enjoying driving and owning it.",2022,11,27
Sadly not.,2022,11,27
"My Vivaro (same EV hardware as your Mokka, and in fact all Stellantis EVs, except the Fiat 500e which was designed by FCA before the merger) says 140 miles in summer, 132 right now at about 5C with a full charge. That's always wrong - in summer I can get 2.1 miles per Kwh, for a range of 95 miles. Right now, it's more like 1.8, so 81. Others in the company report it can go as little as 60 miles (I've only had it a few months, so haven't driven it in midwinter yet).  
 
It's heavily loaded with ladders on the roof ruining the aerodynamics, and even with 5 months of data it doesn't learn.  
 
Stellantis EVs are known to suffer worse than any other EVs in winter, though later versions have a revised final drive and heatpump which ought to improve the range by as much as 10%.  
 
The EV Database gives a more realistic estimate of the range - as low as 110 miles!  Vauxhall Mokka-e",2022,11,27
"@Senti79  I had the same experience. The car itself is amazing, it's quieter and smoother than it should be for such a small car when driving at higher speeds, but when driving at 60mph and upwards, I would find that it could do between 100-120 miles on a full charge and the remaining charge on the battery would go down very quickly with each mile. Rather disappointing.  
 
Driving in the city, I could get up to 240 miles. It's a real shame the efficiency is so bad at higher speeds, it's the main reason why I got rid of it after 3 months.",2022,11,27

If i'm going on a longer trip in our Corsa-e i will reset one of the trip computers before setting off and then you can get a better rough idea of what you can expect to get by doing some quick maths of the miles per kw you are getting multiplied by 47 which most seem to suggest is the usable number of the battery. So for example if you are doing 3.3 miles per kw you could expect to be around 155 miles from the full battery. Its not fool proof but gives you an idea.,2022,11,28
"Yes i was shocked when i drove it to the airport on the M3 the other day i was driving at 70 -75 and less than a 100 mile range ridiculous i had to charge 3 time as i got anxious over range.

"Hello! 
 
First time poster and EV owner here. My better half has just gotten her license (auto only) and decided to opt for the Fiat 500e 24kW. 
 
We currently rent our home and may be looking to move in the next year or so. Ideally, we’d like a home charging solution since the range on the 24kW 500e isn’t the greatest and I don’t want to be sat in our local station car park every day! 
 
Having a gander online I can see things like PodPoint’s are around £700 but with the £350 grant this will obviously work out cheaper. However, I’m reluctant to pay for a charger that I’ll own and add value to a house that’s not “mine”, only to move in 8 months time and have to fork out for a new charger again, this time without the grant (since it’ll have been used). 
 
So, I know that  Egg  isn’t the cheapest solution as it’s £30 a month not including the exorbitant cost of electricity at the moment and I understand owning our charger would be a cheaper option long term BUT given our current circumstances described above, does this seem like a decent short term option or is there something better I should be looking at? 
 
Apologies if this is a noob question, this is our first foray into EV’s and so I’d rather ask people with knowledge than try to figure it all out on my own with no idea what I’m doing. 
 
Thanks in advance, 
Goose! 🙂",2022,6,5

 Get a quote for a fitted charger 
 get a quote for a commando socket (likely cheaper. Do you get a granny cable with the Fiat?)

work out which is cheaper - but bear in mind even if one option is a little more expensive it may also be more convenient to you. Also check the T&Cs for the subscription as you might have a minimum period and worst case they may uninstall if you cancel, which you should also check the landlord would be ok with

"I’ve seen Egg advertised online, looks like a simple short-term option, lots of flexibility, or for those who find the up-front cost of having a charger installed a tough proposition.",2022,6,6
"Charger installation grants now ended so you will be paying full price. Do you have off road parking? Will the landlord agree to amendments to the electrics there? If asked, some landlords will actually fit a wallbox themselves, using a different grant system, and then increase the rent slightly to cover that extra facility. Sometimes using a local public Rapid charger is a far cheaper option in short term situations. Especially if daily mileage is relatively low and only requires a 20-minute visit a couple of times a week. And can be combined with a shopping trip or gym visit for instance. There may even be a streetside slow charger nearby where the car could be parked overnight and a short walk involved. At no installation cost, just slightly more expensive electricity. 
 
A cheap home option is to use a 3 pin 15 amp portable charger - commonly called the granny charger - but as that is really for emergency use it is not recommended for various reasons. Try the forum 'search community' to investigate many threads on this subject. But loads of people have used one exclusively for years. Some have encountered worrying problems though. But as long as the house electrical system is sound, and care is taken, this could solve your problem economically for a short time.",2022,6,6

"Disclaimer: I'm posting an almost identical post on the Hyundai Kona forum, so apologies if you've already seen this. 
 
Brand new to this forum, but proud owner of a 2013 Fiat 500e and the unfortunate, current lessee of an ICE vehicle. I am currently living in Texas (happened to find the Fiat 500e at the local CarMax in 2016 with only 8000 miles on it!), which makes my EV enthusiasm a bit difficult to say the least. My lease is ending soon and my rabbit-hole of a search for an EV to replace my current car has led me to two finalists, the 2019 Kia Niro EV and the 2019 Hyundai Kona EV. I've been in touch with Hyundai and Kia dealerships and done quite a bit of research on these vehicles, but am struggling to really differentiate these cars from one another. 
 
The 2019 Kia Niro EV  is  expected to be delivered to select Texas Kia dealerships in early 2019, as per my conversations with several dealerships. The 2019 Hyundai Kona EV, on the other hand, was not going to show up in Texas at all...and multiple dealerships had told me that I would not even be able to order one to be delivered, so I figured my decision was made for me. 
 
BUT THEN 
 
I saw this article:  Hyundai Will Satisfy U.S. Hunger For Kona Electric  that says that, although California and other ZEV states will be the only states that receive deliveries of the car, Hyundai will ship the 2019 Kona EV to dealers in non-ZEV states if there is a ""sold order"" in place. 
 
So it looks like I have a choice again. I'm ultimately planning on test-driving both vehicles (out of town weddings are a good a time for a test-drive as any, right?), but wanted to see if there was anything else any of you had heard, seen, read, experienced that would lead you to recommend one vehicle over the other?

The  Kia  steering wheel looks naff (but I could live with it), I like the centre console so much more, Media display is nicely embedded in dash and has the space also, but then its more money.

There is little to choose between the two (they are sister companies, so powertrain is identical) other than styling and space differences.

The elmo charging offer is so inferior to the  On.To one. BP pulse means searching out individual chargers (risking in use/out of service/ICEd) rather than using a convenient bank of Instavolt or Ionity on my commute.,2022,4,13
"An update on the registration with Nissan Connect. Nissan customer services reached out to me a couple of days ago saying that the system is now updated and I can register the VIN with the Nissan Connect app. So it now works, finally. All in all, the Elmo team followed up with Nissan frequently, the Nissan customer service people were pretty quick to respond. I think the failure is in the process. An electric car subscription service is not about providing the vehicle. The app is a major part of the user experience. So, the de-registration and registration activities should be part of the handover process. In the handover checklist, together with checks for scuffs and dents, there should be a check on de-registering the car from the app. This will save the next customer’s time, the Elmo team’s time and Nissan team’s time.",2022,4,14
"If Elmo do eventually offer more charging providers I’d like to see them as optional from one another.  
 
Hear me out. 
 
I think it’s fairly obvious that any additional charging providers would be an extra cost. Currently BP access is £10 a month. Say Elmo add Shell and it bumps the price up to £20. 
 
I’d like to see them as separate. I would continue paying £10 for BP and wouldn’t take up the £10 Shell card, as in the past sixteen months I have only used Shell-included chargers at less than £10 a go, so financially it doesn’t make sense for me to pay £10 a month (extra) for something I don’t use.",2022,4,14
"So the ZE50 from Elmo arrived.

Handover was ""interesting"". Chap was lovely and I think he was just trying to be helpful but I didn't really need a tour of the car given I was stood next to my bright blue ZE50. 
 
So initial issues; can't pair the app. Car is reporting data as disconnected, app says there are no contracts(!). Elmo looking into it. 
 
As I'm typing this I'm sat in the car waiting for the daughter at one of her many out of school activities and the car is switched off and merrily making loads of clicking noises every couple of minutes.

"A couple of changes I've not noticed before. 
 
You can now choose between Morning and Afternoon delivery - used to be ""it'll turn up at some point"". 
 
You can pay £15 a month for Excess Waiver (reduced excess) - but I can't see this as an option when trying to book a car, nor what it reduces the £1000 excess down to. 
 
 
There's a 25p/mile charge if you're over your mileage allowance. Wording seems to say you can average no more than 1500 miles per month. 
 
 
Delivery is now £119... 
 
 ""Delivery. A flat delivery fee of £119 is applicable for drivers in England and Wales. Cars delivered to Scotland will pay an extra delivery fee.""  Also seems to be the same price for Collection. 
 
...BUT it looks like they've removed the £95 Admin Fee at the start of a new Subscription. More expensive for me based on the old model, but much cheaper for anyone who lives more than 75 miles from their Depot in Oxfordshire (which was 50 miles free, then £1.20 per mile after that). 
 
However, this is where it hugely differs. I live (just) within 50 miles from their depot, so my delivery and collection and under the old rules were free (but I had to pay the £95 admin fee). Now, it is £119 each way - which for me would be an increase (Collection plus Delivery) of £143. I wonder if I'll have to pay the £119 Collection Fee when my current car goes back...",2022,9,27
"That's some interesting changes, I have an MG5 being delivered on Friday and I give the Polestar back.  
Not seen any of these changes, may have to go back and look at my contract. At least for the mileage changes, as that's always been a pain with Onto before.",2022,9,27
"I have just gone back through my contract and it is 35p+VAT per mile overage charge up to 1500, 50p+VAT for 1500 - 2000 and £1+VAT for anything above 2000. Originally delivery and collection fees still apply. 
 
I definitely went over my allowance in the Polestar, luckily I had it confirmed at 10p previously. Suppose I will just need to be a bit more cautious on the miles! 
 
We are going down to a 1-car household in the next couple months, so only a short-term concern.",2022,9,28

"Onto and Elmo are probably on par now with the changes they have put in recently. It is just going to come down to personal circumstances what works best, so things like mileage per month, charging networks near you/on your commute, do you have a home-charger, what car do you like! 
 
Elmo have better CS in my opinion, much more open to sorting problems, although as said above, they have lost their edge since the cinch buyout.  
 
If you do more than 800 miles per month regularly, or have a long trip within your hire period, Elmo are ahead as they change mileage based on your entire hire time, rather than month to month with Onto which is painful.

ElmoSave ties you in to a lower monthly for a minimum of 12 months, ElmoFlex is higher monthly cost, but minimum of 60 days (then 30 days notice after that).

Fiat 500e La Prima 42kWh is £449 a month on ElmoSave, or £499 on ElmoFlex. 
Renault Zoe GT Line+ EV50 (Rapid) 52kWh is £422 a month on ElmoSave or £469 on ElmoFlex.

"Disclaimer: I'm posting an almost identical post on the Kia Niro forum, so apologies if you've already seen this. 
 
Brand new to this forum, but proud owner of a 2013 Fiat 500e and the unfortunate, current lessee of an ICE vehicle. I am currently living in Texas (happened to find the Fiat 500e at the local CarMax in 2016 with only 8000 miles on it!), which makes my EV enthusiasm a bit difficult to say the least. My lease is ending soon and my rabbit-hole of a search for an EV to replace my current car has led me to two finalists, the 2019 Kia Niro EV and the 2019 Hyundai Kona EV. I've been in touch with Hyundai and Kia dealerships and done quite a bit of research on these vehicles, but am struggling to really differentiate these cars from one another. 
 
The 2019 Kia Niro EV  is  expected to be delivered to select Texas Kia dealerships in early 2019, as per my conversations with several dealerships. The 2019 Hyundai Kona EV, on the other hand, was not going to show up in Texas at all...and multiple dealerships had told me that I would not even be able to order one to be delivered, so I figured my decision was made for me. 
 
BUT THEN 
 
I saw this article:  Hyundai Will Satisfy U.S. Hunger For Kona Electric  that says that, although California and other ZEV states will be the only states that receive deliveries of the car, Hyundai will ship the 2019 Kona EV to dealers in non-ZEV states if there is a ""sold order"" in place. 
 
So it looks like I have a choice again. I'm ultimately planning on test-driving both vehicles (out of town weddings are a good a time for a test-drive as any, right?), but wanted to see if there was anything else any of you had heard, seen, read, experienced that would lead you to recommend one vehicle over the other? 
 
Thanks in advance, appreciate the help!",2018,11,15
"The Kona is a known quantity, but it think H have sufficient orders to cover the entire first year's production, i.e. until August next year I think.

"The Kona went on sale online-only 6 months before dealers will get them; if the e-Niro does the same, by the time you can get a test drive, you're likely to be looking at a 1+ year waiting time. On the other hand you can put a deposit down and hope the delivery date is after the dealers get them, then you can sneak in a test drive and cancel it if you don't like it ",2018,11,15

It was a test drive with a model similar to the one I've ordered, basically just in another colour. Took it from the Fiat garage in Bertrange to Echternach and back. Drove it in the city, on narrow country roads, a wide national road and a motorway. 
So far I'm marvelled by the 500e. I tried out the Range and the Sherpa modes to which I got used almost instantely. On the wide national road and the motorway I tested the nearly autonomous drive, which to my surprise works extremely well. 
Nice plus: My girlfriend likes the car too.

Compared to that, this looks easier for someone hiring the car because the car is available for instant pick up but less convenient for the person hiring out the car because they effectively surrender their car for half the month. I guess if you had 2 cars and only needed 1 on a daily basis, this could pay for your motoring. 
Turo works well for hiring with a few days notice as there is a bit of to and fro with the owner. The keyless entry with Karshare is great for both parties but I wonder what the damage inspection at pick up and drop off is like - could be open to abuse / arguments.",2021,2,18
"In theory, I could be very interested in this. I have home charging, and live 5 minutes from a Metro station, so quite appealing for potential customers. There's also an ICE car share at the end of my street.

Obviously a lot would depend on the timing. How far in advance do you need to commit to the days? And can you back out if plans change. Maybe you have to rehire your own car?!

Frankly it wasn't the UK that lead on this, but .... 
 
Cars before this time had optional VESS with some not being fitted with any and others having off switches (that toggled back to on when the car was switched Off and On again) to turn them off. It used to be illegal for cars to make reversing noises, but now its allowed. 
 
I would assume that your C4 complies with the new law and hence makes noise up to 20 MPH which you cannot turn off. It is possible if the C4 gained type approval before the 2019 date that even ones produced today are silent. Have you tried asking someone else to drive past you at a slow speed in your car?

"Hi All, 
 
I picked up my i3 from EVEZY last week and thought we could all do with a place to share experiences and answer any questions people may have about the process. 
 
First some background 
 
EVEZY are a short term electric car lease company with a unique business model. 
 
1) You rent the car month by month, no deposit and no minimum term (well a month minimum technically but you pay in advance) 
2) Rental includes insurance (£1000 excess though in fault claims) up to 1000 miles. month, tax and all maintenance costs 
3) you do not get a key, you use an app to lock and unlock the car. 
4) You can pick cars up and drop them off and ""depots"" around the country. 
 
You can use a referral code (see below   ) to get £50 off your first month. 
 
My experiences so far.  
 
I phoned on Wednesday and asked for a 120 i3. No problems at all; arranged pickup the next day from Windsor 
 
Took the train to Windsor only to realise it is a 4 mile trip to the pickup point, I stupidly decided to walk. The pickup point is not obvious and is actually someone's house (the cars are all parked in a big yard) There were at least 3 i3s and a few Zoes there as well. 
 
Once I find the car (the reg is on the app) it connect to the app via bluetooth and a button unlocks the car. The car was brand new and still had the plastic seat covers on so I was pleasantly surprised (note there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.) 
 
The only hitch was that the 3 pin cable to charge the car is in the front boot and the button on the app did not seem to work. I phoned them and it is a known problem that they are working on (hint to EVEZY, if this is an issue don't put the charging cable in the boot!) Fortunately I RTFM and found the emergency release wire in the cabin so used that to open and move the cable into the back boot. 
 
Car is great, there is a dash-cam but you soon forget about that, otherwise it is just like a normal i3. When I got home I was able to activate the BMW connected app and set preconditioning times etc so that all works like a normal car.  
 
Overall I am very impressed, the lease is cheaper than most other places and far more flexible, it also includes insurance so that is another saving. My only concern is the app but it is working fine so far. I have only had to enter the password once but do now carry my reading glasses everywhere I go! 
 
My referral code is in my sig. I know others have codes as well so feel free to contribute and people can pick a code at random! 
 
Please feel free to ask any more questions if you have them.",2019,3,5
"Hope you enjoy it. I was tempted, but I can't really stomach the price difference. The extra range and faster CCS is tempting though.",2020,12,22
"Tried out my  On.To Shell card at the Osprey chargers in Skipton today, absolutely nothing, zero, ziltch when I plugged in, activated it and put the card onto the RFID reader. No idea if it's related but those particular Osprey chargers weren't on the Shell map when I last looked, but are on the Osprey map. They're relatively new, but by a few months rather than a few days. They went live some time over early summer (2 units). I'll try again tomorrow maybe activating first before plugging in or something, but so far they don't appear to work with the card.",2020,12,26
"Just an update from my Zoe return, I was told I was responsible for a very very minor dot of missing paint on door edge which I know I didn’t do. So extra checking needed when you pickup or get a delivery as I must have not seen it when it was delivered.",2020,12,26
"Hi all, 
 
Just a quick write up on my recent experiences with Onto. I received a Zoe ZE40 around 2nd April which I kept until 11th August when I swapped for a ZE50. The old car was picked up and was apparently going straight to auction. On 15th September I received notification that I was going to be charged for damage to the car (to the tune of nearly £500 for four items), I replied back the same day disputing two of the items. I eventually received a reply back on 9th November (about 8 weeks after my email). The email essentially said the items I queried were 'outside of the BVRLA Guidelines' so that was that. One of them was for an alloy repair, I have tried to query what I've actually been charged for but no one has been able to tell me. Here is the photo:",2020,12,30

I swapped to Elmo and since then all good so far. I’m living in fear expecting Onto’s damage invoice email tho. 5-6 weeks ago the into ZE40 was returned and haven’t heard back from them (at all) yet.,2020,12,30
"It's a shame that IF they had cars available that they couldn't shift at their Depots, that people who want to temporarily suspend for a month or two can't just pay a nominal fee (to cover insurance) and have the cars sat on the driveways, but immobilised by  on.to. Then when you want to restart it's a quick call and payment and off you go. 
 
I mean I can see why they wouldn't, but if they had an abundance of vehicles it would save them (and subscribers) so much hassle. 
 
 
On the subject of contact I emailed them a few weeks ago about something... and nothing. That was my final deciding push to go with Elmo instead.",2021,1,7

Moving to a lease because we're fairly committed to needing a car, and once you get into larger, longer range vehicles Onto starts to get pretty expensive. I still think it's a great deal for many vehicles, and the Shell card is huge news. No brainer if you want lack of commitment but have the income to afford the car and are happy to spend it.

First impressions of the Kona are good. The interior is nicer than expected, although the overall quality is (as is to be expected) not quite up to the standards of the i3. It will definitely be more suitable overall for our journey profile - it’s nice to be back in a car with an 'auto-pilot' system. 
 
Fairly sure it won’t be as much fun to drive when not on a motorway, but more comfortable for sure. 
 
For those potentially interested in a Kona from Onto, mine came direct from Tilbury and arrived with 50 miles on the odometer.",2021,1,20
I was just asking because I think the pugs came with they key,2021,1,20
With or without Polar and Shell Cards?,2021,1,20
"Actually, we test drove a Kona after a year with an i3. I seriously rated it. Drove like a little Polo GTI - I really enjoyed it. Easily as fun as the i3, and more planted because of its lower stance. If you put your foot down it GOES. 
 
Downside was it wasn't particularly big, and as tall people with a dog it didn't feel as practical as the ID3... or even the i3, strangely, which is deceptively big. The interior isn't as nice as the i3... but what interior is! 
 
Think you'll enjoy it.",2021,1,20
"Just announced... 
 
Hey guys! Great news again",2021,1,20
"Hi team. New member here very much playing catch up and spent a bunch of time reading through Onto's discussion forum over the weekend (only to have just found this one! 🙈 - I won't pretend to have read more than about a hundred of the >6600 posts in this thread) 
 
I live in London with my fiancé and in a normal world we get by without a car no worries. We usually hire whenever we need and haven't taken a lot of domestic trips in the past (I'm an Aussie expat having lived here for almost 4 years now). I'm also a zipcar member (free tier) which was helpful, but the state of the shared fleet varies wildly and I do worry about catching something nasty from someone.  
 
With COVID impacting international travel, I'm anticipating that we'll want to explore much more of the UK this year, or at least for the 3-6 months after this lockdown eases. The idea of catching mass transit at the moment really doesn't appeal -- TLDR I want to get us some wheels for at least a few months this year, probably from ~April or maybe May.  
 
I've been getting bombarded with ads online for Onto recently, and quite like the proposition, but I wanted to check before I signed up if my logic was sound--  
 
Is it something I can sign up to and then commit to / request a vehicle in advance? (e.g. start in mid April or May?) Is it better to wait until later on to apply? (I assume there's some kind of approval/account review, but no idea how long that takes). When you sign up, are you able to opt to defer taking delivery/pickup of a vehicle? (Right now we're both WFH so have no real need for a vehicle in this lockdown)  
 
I've done a whole bunch of reading and think I have my heart set on the e-208 (prob the GT-- though now that it's the 'new GT' not sure if that still make sense?). I have read the range is a bit rubbish, but aside from experiencing the Zipcar eGolf I've got no clue what real world impact it'll have. I live about a 10min walk / 5min drive from 4x BP 150W chargers and now that Shell's in the picture think the charging network looks pretty decent.  
 
The other thing I'd plan to do would be to get excess reduction insurance -- I already have a rental car excess policy through 'insurance4carhire' which I had for rental vehicles separately, from what I've read that seems to cover Onto as well?  
 
I'd really appreciate any tips, thought or advice (hopefully flame free!). I feel like I spent half my weekend planning virtual routes with zap-map and reading up on charging, dreaming about drives through the country or to the coast and being free from the bounds of where my legs or bicycle can take me!",2021,2,1
"Your plan looks pretty good to me. They also have a good helpchat thing on their website so you could try that. 
 
I like using ABRP to plan routes, compare different cars etc.. 
 
I use IC4H as well.",2021,2,1
"Just from me: insurance4carhire cover Onto, and I've had a successful claim with them.",2021,2,1
"FYI the i3 from Onto do not have Carplay, and there's no way to get it activated - speaking as someone who had an i3 from Onto for a year and looked into it. Having said that the navigation is really good once you get used to it (it integrates completely with the range estimates) and pretty easy to setup routes from the app. Biggest downside is the address database is poor. Even the entertainment interface gets easy to use after a few months!",2021,2,1
Have you considered Elmo? Their availability is better and you get a key,2021,2,1
"Please do not rely on public charging with a non-Tesla EV, it’s more hassle than it’s worth. Have you considered a hybrid?",2021,2,1
"I had a Zoe 22 with no home charging for 6 months. Luckily my local charger broke on the 7th month, after I’d sold the car.",2021,2,1
Oh yeah - I was just referencing the guy who mentioned the Zoe 22 above ,2021,2,1
"@tyson  I've also just a few weeks ago had a successful insurance claim with Innsurance4carhire excess cover (£40 ish per year). 
Someone reversed into my OnTo Tesla M3 SR+ parked outside my house, I had all the camera footage with clear number plate etc. Looked like a straightforward claim in my favour, but it still fell thru (presume they weren't insured or something). Didn't get my £1k excess back from OnTo (invoice was £1700). So claimed thru I4CH and got paid my £1k excess within a few days. 
Just about to renew my I4CH 12 month excess cover policy and I think it's now about £46 for another 12 months. Definitely worth keeping an eye on these threads, I can't thank the core 'group' enough for the heads up on recommendations like this.",2021,2,1
I’m also yet to hear any horror stories about “damage” spotted on return to Elmo. Onto have recently gone a bit “Enterprise” with their assessments.,2021,2,2
"Thanks all. Will check out the other thread also and possibly drop Elmo a note. Still no reply to my contact form from Onto from Friday which is a bit poor for a prospective customer.  
 
",2021,2,2
"Yes, directly comparing teenage Onto with toddler Elmo is perhaps a little unfair I think. Also applies to things like customer service. It’s probably easier to provide great customer service every time to everyone when you are are just a fledgling company with a very small customer base. Onto have, by the sounds of it (but not in my personal experience), been going through some growing pains, and perhaps they are just yet to come for Elmo.",2021,2,2
"Some good news on pricing... 
 
In the last few months we’ve been working very hard to improve our service, always striving to optimise our operations and improve our efficiency so that we can bring the best value to our subscribers. 
 
Recent improvements have enabled us to adjust the prices on 2 of our models: The  Renault Zoe GT Line  and the  Hyundai IONIQ Premium 38kWh , allowing us to translate those savings ONTO you! 
 
Now the Renault Zoe GT Line will be £399 per month, while the Hyundai IONIQ Premium 38kWh will be £419. 
 
These price changes will be effective  from  tomorrow , for both existing and new customers. 
 
 
What does this mean for you? 
 
The new price will be reflected from the moment you book the car. These new prices are only valid  starting on February 10th, 2021 , and no discounts will be applied retrospectively.",2021,2,9
"Good news. It leaves me in a bit of a quandary though. 
 
I'm without a car at the moment. Was planning on downgrading from the GT Line to the Iconic when I pick up my subscription again after lockdown, but the price difference is only £10 now!",2021,2,9
The Ioniq is quite tempting at that price - just wish the charging performance was a little better than it is.,2021,2,9
"Audi e-tron available- £1299 a month 
 
New website shows this…",2021,2,12
"I’m still yet to understand why anyone buys, leases or subscribes to an e-tron.",2021,2,12
Am I the only one wanting the ID3 in subscription mode? Only thing I dislike about the ZOE50 is the charging curve tbh.,2021,2,12

T hank you for contacting Fiat. 
 
Following your recent enquiry and as discussed with the customer care agent over the phone, we recommend completing the operations below: 
 
Ensure that you are in an area that has a good internet coverage, proceed with a radio restart followed by a key cycle: from the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Radio restart. 
Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on. 
 
Should you continue to experience any issues, repeat the radio restart + key cycle up to 3-4 times. 
 
If this still does not work, then try with a further Factory reset: rom the radio menu: Vehicle> Settings> Reset> Factory settings. 
 
Once the radio has restarted, do key off - key on. 
 
Please do not hesitate to contact our Customer Relations team from Monday to Friday between 09:00 and 18:00 on 00800 3428 0000, choosing option number 2. 
 
Yours sincerely,

"I'll kick this off. 
 
I'd like to see the ability to have charging stop at a selected time or charge level. Quite a lot of us have a tarriff with a window of low charges. It would be easier to keep within this by having this added functionality.  
 
My wife has a 500e and the Fiat app has this ability. Also a Stellantis product?",2022,8,8
"They should scrap the current version of the app entirely  
It seems they have had a number of people take a crack at it with different fields In their database beingvused for numerous purposes which has lead to a lot of confusion, errors abs issues which should never have been seen. 
A lot of work they did was scrapped and they went back to a newer version which had removed loads of features around trips. Seemingly it was implemented without getting the basics right as there were a number of flaws. 
If the read their own documentation about their own API and redid that (as third party developers appear to believe is on the cards) during the process actually set in stone which fields are used for which data and keep to that then they could write a new app ysing all the existing functions that can be done plus adding functions that many other manufacturers have. 
Better charging control. 
Remote control of climate that works properly. 
Remote unlock and lock 
Remote setting of alarm 
Remote horn 
12v state of charge display and conditioning. 
User configurable settings for cutoff points where things should stop working to protect the battery. 
Geolocation that works correctly. 
Allow the user to select what they wish to see for charging data so % kW or miles should all be displayed but a choice of which figure is most prominent. 
The ability to pop up and alert when a certain SoC is reached so people can start making the way back to the CP knowing more accurately what to expect. 
 
It would also be really useful to be able to configure settings for the car which currently have to be done through the infotainment centre. 
 
I'd like to see the ability to access all of this on a separate tablet without affecting the app on the phone but that plus tge other functionality for the app would need properly implemented security so that a third party could not compromise the vehicle.

"I'd quite like the logging of journeys in the app to include the start and end percentage, get an idea of how much you used etc.",2022,8,9

"We got our first EV - a 2014 BMW i3 (trading in my 2008 535xi estate) six years ago. We swapped that out for a Chevrolet Bolt in 2017 with my wife selling her ICE 18 months in an attempt to become a one-car family. Have made numerous 1000 mile+ trips in the Bolt - totally up to the task. Given our schedules, the one-car plan only lasted a few weeks until I noticed a used bright orange 2013 Fiat 500e selling for only $5000 so picked that up as our local runabout. Pre lockdown we spent quite a bit of time with our family in the UK and hoping to be able to do that again next year (fingers crossed).",2020,11,19
"Welcome! Sadly the Bolt never made it to Uk - a few got to Netherlands/Norway maybe as Ampera-e before GM canned it. Volt Mk1 is still about the best engineered Rex here in Uk, again, sadly, GM never brought Volt Mk2 to Europe either. I rather think they lost their nerve, just as Merc for e.g. are bringing out - guess what - a plugin-hybrid with 10.6 kWh usable battery!!! Technically still not a patch on the Voltec system, and virtually identical battery capacity to the Volt Mk1! Bolt would do well over here I think, but looks like VW's ID.3 will be filling the long-range-but-cheaper-than-Tesla-and-its-a-hatchback slot. 2013 Fiat 500e seems to be a cracking little car, if you can get hold of one!",2020,11,19
"A fellow Californian! 
 
Welcome to Speak EV  @Wastedspacer ! 
 
The Fiat 500e is especially fun to drive.",2020,11,20
"Having driven the eGolf for a short while recently (don't ask) I was mightily impressed, it felt like a nippy Golf without the noise, was lovely. Having gazed longingly from afar at the Fiat 500e. Having been bewitched by my time driving the MINI E all those years ago. Having spent far too many hours of my life sprinting down country lanes and nipping across roundabouts I have to wonder... 
 
Where's our hot hatch battery electric vehicle? 
 
Surely this could/should/would be one of the key ice-breakers in terms of EV adoption. Get people in a small(ish) EV with good performance and decent range... but most importantly compact and quick, and I'm sure you'll win ever more hearts and minds. 
 
Am I mad in thinking this is a market that could really, really benefit from BEVs? I mean they already claim them as city cars, the hot hatch is only one step beyond that surely?",2014,9,2
"I seem to remember some time ago, that Nissan were thinking about an open top, two seater version of the Leaf? I think there was a concept Nismo branded car at some stage? Just imagine how fabulous a 'Roadster' style Leaf with a 50kWh battery would be....?",2014,9,2
Don't count on it; it's a City car. It has hot hatch 0-60 already. The limitations for hot status will be the height (CoG) and skinny tyres.,2014,9,2
"The i3 underpinnings could work surely, even the LEAF. I don't know why someone wont take that risk if it's a repackaging case. The GTE and others like it are a good thing, I imagine that's going to be a beast, but for those unconvinced by electric drive it could possibly re-enforce that battery alone just isn't good enough... and surely it is, if someone is bold enough.",2014,9,2
"I haven't driven one but my understanding is the i3 is hot hatch quick, isn't ?",2014,9,2
"Close in terms of 0-60, but not really quite there, it also doesn't have any of the traditional/accepted ""hot hatch"" appearance or style traits really.",2014,9,2
"0-62 has to be sub seven these days I reckon to be a ""true"" hot hatch. 
 
That also does rather look like a small family hatch back with a weird paint job imho.   Like the look of the wheels mind you.",2014,9,2
"i only ever saw the golf as a hot hatch. but it was not very quick most hot hatch can't get sub seven, like the Honda civic typeR 200bhp 7.1 0-62, Renault clio 172/182/ 7.1sec the Renault clio 197. 7sec dead. but my evo4 (4.6) sec 0-62 474bhp oh how i miss that car but not the fuel bill lol",2014,9,2
"I've found the Fiat 500e to be the closest to the Roadster for EVs for ""fun to drive"" factor...",2014,9,3
I wish Mitsubishi had built this...,2014,9,4
"That's never going to appeal to the ""hot hatch"" mob looking like that methinks.    
 
Would fit on a scifi set though, and why not, who says cars have to be ""car shaped"", we should get over that. As long as they fit on the road and parking spaces I wish folk would be a bit more bold in their tastes. This is one thing I always loved Renault for, they made some pig-ugly freakish cars, but I'm glad someone was bold enough to do it. ",2014,9,5
Have you ever driven around or just outside Milton Keynes? Can be great fun if you're sensible and hot-hatch heaven at times. ,2014,9,7
"Although the CEO of Fiat says he is losing money on every one, reports would suggest it would sell like hot cakes in many markets but is only a compliance car at the moment. 
 
The following link  100-Plus Racers Just Bought Fiat 500e Electric Cars  suggests that for around £750 down and £55 a month you can have the lovely Fiat 500 EV.

"It's great to live in California...

"Never been to California, but I'd like to. If I could try a 500e at the same time.... ",2015,3,18
"Not sure why you think this  isn't  creeping price rises in several stages.  
 
The company's strategy is ""car as a service"". But it seems they made it so cheap people have used it as ""car as ownership"" in competition with 2 or 3 year lease offers.",2022,3,2
Given the anger on their own forum and Twitter they will have loads of cars and no money come august,2022,3,2
"Anyone got an idea of the average length a customer stays with them? 
 
Must be less than 6 months, surely? It would be insane to pay a premium for the flexibility of short leases, then have a long lease anyway. 
 
The fundamental problem of their business model is nearly everyone needs a car on a time horizon of several years. Only a few want a short term stopgap - planning to emigrate, waiting for a new release, changing jobs... And for those few it's much cheaper, though less convenient, to buy an ageing used car and sell it on after a few months.",2022,3,2

"I didn't' notice anything in the Onto's general terms. I have not checked the rental contract. 
 
I did notice this: 
 
5. The Driver must accurately, truthfully and fully complete the application process and deliver all information and documents required under the application process. 
 
So it comes down to where they will deliver a car. In any case Onto have a fixed fee for delivery and collection.",2022,3,4
My Onto Model 3 was delivered to and registered at a flat I’d moved out of 6 months previously for ease of collection. A week or so after I’d collected the car I just emailed them to say id “moved” to my actual address. They never updated it anyway.,2022,3,4
"Hello all, wondering if you can help me with some advice regarding ONTO or an EV subscription in general. 
 
I'm looking at getting a car in the next few months as I finally have the spare money to do so and I love the idea of having an electric car. 
 
ONTO appeals to me as it's a one month subscription so I'm not tied down (something which scares me after being a freelancer in the past) and comes as one package with insurance and charging etc and doesn't require a huge deposit. 
 
I was looking at a Zoe GT Line but they've recently removed the £450pm option and now only offer one for £500. Now that's not a huge jump but I'm questioning whether it's value for money as I worry I won't be doing anywhere near the mileage required to make it smart. 
 
My biggest issue at the minute is trying to figure out whether I'd be better just getting an ICE car, which would of course be cheaper. My assumption was fuel costs and whatever else would push me close to £500 a month anyway. 
 
In short, is the extra money a month worth not being tied down to a 48 month PCP deal and having to pay a deposit that I don't have? Or is there a cheaper way to get myself on the EV ladder? Any help or advice would be more than welcome, and please assume I am a complete novice in this area!",2022,5,6
Get something cheap on a 3 year PCP and you can give it back for a break even after a few months in the current climate.,2022,5,6
"The ONTO offer seems expensive at the moment, as there has just been a major price increase. There shouldn’t be any further hikes for about a year at least, as ONTO don’t like to review their tariffs more frequently than they need to. No doubt their competitors will need to review their charges in the not too distant future, which should narrow the gap. Whether the maths work really depends on your individual circumstances, and what value you place on flexibility. Obviously if you live in a high risk area, and don’t have any NCB, the included insurance could be worth a lot. If you charge cheaply at home and rarely use public charging, then the BP, InstaVolt and Shell Cards don’t really add any value for you. Other companies such as Cazoo are now offering EV subscriptions, so it seems it’s not a flawed model.",2022,5,7
Note Elmo do offer unlimited BP charging if you pay £10 per month. They should advertise this bit more...,2022,5,7
"PCPs are disposable at pretty much any point. I’ve never had a 3 year one longer than 6 months, and usually had a zero or sub-£1k cost to return.",2022,5,7
"Hopefully someone with an Onto subscription can answer this. 
 
My wife has ordered an Onto vehicle to use until her Polestar arrives in September. She starts a new job in July and has just noticed that on her first day she has to show them her vehicle insurance certificate proving business use. 
 
She works in an office, so no Deliveroo etc. The business use is purely to cover going to her company’s different sites and the occasional meeting at a customer’s site. 
 
Is anyone else in a similar situation, and if so what have you done to make sure you have appropriate insurance cover? 
 
We emailed Onto and asked if they’re ok with going to her company’s other sites, which they are. However, that’s not evidence enough and an insurance certificate is required to prove it. We obviously can’t get that until the vehicle arrives, but then that would be too late if she’s not covered.",2022,6,3
Any comments on what wait times are for ONTO at the moment? The last time I looked year ago nothing was available and I got no notifications for the vehicles I enquired about.,2022,6,5
"There’s now a post code checker which is really useful for showing cars with availability. Once you get to the booking stage of one of those it’ll give you an exact date. 
There are quite a few available in my area.",2022,6,6
"Wow, those prices have gone right off the deep end… are they still somehow managing to fudge the figures on the product pages to appear competitive with leasing, or did they give up on that?",2022,10,28

"From Rob Jolly, Onto CEO... 
 
 As of 1st December 2022, our delivery, collection and swap prices will be as follows: 
 
Delivery or collection will increase from £99.50 to £129.50. 
Swapping a car will increase from £49.50 to £79.50. 
 
That means if you book a delivery, collection or swap before 1st Dec, you will pay the current price, regardless of the delivery date. For example, if you book a delivery on 17th Nov for a delivery date on 5th Dec you will pay £99.50. Any delivery, collection or swap booked from 1st Dec onwards will be at the new price.",2022,11,15
"I didn't agree with many that the costs were high for the previous cars noted in this thread, but £1,499 for a Y... The Model 3 LR is £1,299 with Onto, but to lease it, is more expensive than a Y. That's the first car that really is at a premium. Though with increased financing costs etc, it's not a surprise.",2022,11,25
"Onto's Pricing is ridiculous for a car, but its not far off Teslas PCP deal... which is scary as well",2022,11,25
The MFG network has just been added to the Shell Card so this will mean extra chargers included in the ONTO subscription.,2022,12,1
That’s also excellent news for all the other roaming providers who give access to Shell!,2022,12,1
"Having checked it's not April 1st and that I'm not dreaming, ONTO have gone crazy with their pricing and charging offering. I get that the world is upside down at the moment, but wow! Up until recently, I had a Kona which I was paying for the extra 1000 miles on as I do about 1750 a month which came in at £759... After 8th January it will cost £1009 A MONTH (£709+£300) for the same car and miles with a reduced charging package! 
 
 New monthly subscription prices;",2022,12,8
"Crikey, so a Zoe GT Line+ will be £80 a month more than it is with Elmo, for less miles and a higher over-mileage cost? 
 
If Elmo can keep their prices down and can get decent numbers of cars in stock I can’t understand why people would chose Onto. 
 
It'll be interesting to see how Onto display their new prices vs Leasing as it’s already a bit of a farce.",2022,12,9
"Losing BP Pulse and (effectively) instavolt are a huge loss for me.  
 
I guess this turns ONTO into more the temporary car hire, and less and less the cheap lease that we've been using it for.",2022,12,10
"After returning an Onto car they inspect and email about charges for damages. In that damages emails it has a link to an ""Inspection report"" and ""Report at collection"". These are links to PDF on their Google Drive account. But those files cannot be saved or printed! How ridiculous. 
I need them to send to for an excess insurance claim.",2023,1,31
Hi Does anyone have any intro codes for any of these short - medium term hire services,2023,2,1
"ONTO are now trialling a “no charging included” subscription on Tier 1 vehicles in their fleet. This basically means paying £60 a month less to forfeit the Shell Recharge Card. So, if you live in London or the South East, and don’t mind an ONTO branded Fiat 500e, you can hire an EV from as little as £339 a month. There are delivery/collection charges, but these can be reduced somewhat by using a referral code to get £100 off the first months sub.",2023,2,6
"Does anyone know if it will be an issue for Onto or Elmo that I haven´t owned a car in the UK for years as a result of living abroad? I have no claims ever (a clean record from 2008 to when I started driving until 2013), but from about 2013/2014 to present there is going to be nothing in the record at all as a result of not owning a car in the UK at all in that period. i.e. they might see I haven´t had car insurance 
 
When I come back and apply does anyone know if that will be an issue? Has anyone here ever replied with a blank record like that? Looking at the eligibility criteria, it might be OK? 
 
I could just ask them, but I´d rather not draw attention to the issue by asking, I´d rather just apply not mentioning it.",2023,5,9

"Thank you for the welcome and I appreciate the offer of help!   
 
I chose the exclusive model, didn't think I was a person that would be sold on cheap thrills but my girlfriend and I loved the panoramic sunroof when we test drove one a few weeks ago haha! Blue was the only one they had left so I will be getting that one. Think I prefer the red though. 
 
I drive around 75 miles a day round trip to work almost exclusively on motorway/dual carriageway, so I am interested to see how often I need to charge it. I live in a flat with only on street parking too, hoping to be reliant on work charging. Some days fast chargers aren't available however, so I'm also keen to find out if I can rely on granny charging. As well as trying out the overall EV life and enjoying the ZS experience! I've wanted to convert for ages now. I work in aviation and drive an ICE car so I have no environmental credibilty whatsoever haha. 
 
I will email to ask about the referral code, poor Lucas has had me pestering him a lot!",2021,4,30
"Thanks very much! I have emailed Lucas and I have spoken to everyone at work, but they have plugs at home and work, so they just plug it in at both ends on a first come first-served basis. I might be doing some bribing!",2021,4,30
"Thanks for that, we are a good team of people so I am sure we can come to an agreement. Hopefully we can convince our work about installing more points, because quite a few people have been test driving EV's lately.",2021,4,30
"Yes, unfortunately i think you will need to charge every day.  
 
Agreed on the dashboard set up. What were MG thinking when they decided not to put a battery percentage reading anywhere in the car? It can tell me the temp of each tyre to a decimal point but can't tell me what percentage SoC of my battery. Would be comical if not so annoying!",2021,5,5
"Tempted to pause ONTO for a month just to try the Honda E via Elmo. 
It looks so much fun 😃",2021,10,18

"Despite the range that mini is tempting! Especially at level 3 spec.  
Nice to see the team at elmo have done some work on filling their car roster. Like above, some additional charging options would be good to see.",2021,11,5
"I agree on the charging situation although it very dependent on the user situation.  
 
In my case I mostly use my local council’s 7 and 50kWs (Greater Manchester;  Be.EV) which were free until the end of Sept. I don’t have a charging solution and home and their chargers are at work and in convenient locations for me. This first month having to pay for it for example, I used it for 125kWh (and I was for 1 week in France anyways). These wouldn’t have been covered by those charging solutions included in Onto. However I do understand that might be the opposite for other people.  
 
Said this, I am very jealous of having all of those included and I’d love to have them but currently, doesn’t make economic sense for me to change.",2021,11,6

Glad to see elmo getting additional selection in, with these surprise additions like the mini (can see they are going to add the level 2 as well which is great!) and the MG 
 
Really surprised to have seen the polestar added as was expecting it to fall under the Volvo sub but glad it didn’t!",2021,12,3
"And now… 
 
Mercedes EQA, Kia Niro 39 and 64kWh and Nissan Leaf 62kWh!!",2021,12,3

"They’ve re-stocked the Zoes as well. Good to see so much available now, I wonder if they’ll get much trade from Onto’s seeming lack of cars",2021,12,3
What I find slightly surprising is why Elmo don't email out all their current subscribers when they release new cars. Find that a bit odd.,2021,12,8

Pretty sure the id4 is only a life with onto so you are getting a better spec car,2021,12,9

BCA driver was brilliant, very friendly and informative. 
 
Initial impressions are good, but without the pilot pack (I only ordered the standard) I do miss some of the intuitive systems on the ID3 which was in the base life spec. 
 
Much prefer the infotainment system, the integration with Google is great imo and very easy. Quick QR scan and login and away you go!

"Thank you. Leaf received and looks good. In fact, a little too good, no scratches or scuffs. I'd prefer if it had a few, I wouldn't have to worry too much   The problem now is that NissanConnect does not allow me to register the VIN, as apparently it has already been registered by someone else. I would think that these issues with rentals would have been ironed out by now, but alas. Anyone know how can this be fixed?",2022,3,25
"Thank you. Emailed Elmo yesterday and they said they will pass it on to the fleet team for resolution. Keeping fingers crossed. I had to charge at a public charger today and I went back twice to check the progress, which is a waste of time. Need that app!",2022,3,26
"For anyone considering Elmo for an EV subscription: I am in the 3rd week of renting a Leaf, and while the Elmo people have been fairly responsive in responding to emails and even calling me on the subject, I still don’t have the ability to register the car with the Nissan Connect app, due to a previous renter having registered the car with his/hers and never de-registering. After two weeks they asked me to email Nissan the rental agreement, which I did, but still waiting to hear back. Two issues here: a) The de-registering process should be automatic or part of the handover process. To give the car back you have to show that you have de-registered from the Nissan app. B) People should be courteous and de-registering the car from their Nissan app when they hand it over. I thought EV people are more conscientious than average!",2022,4,6

My wife and I live about an hour north of Glasgow and have made the decision to switch to electric. We have a diesel Subaru Outback and a Fiat Panda 4x4 but they’re going soon -a Tesla is on the way within a month with something small for me to runabout in for work. It’s pretty mountainy where we are and I’m looking for something that can handle a 30 mile each way trip a few times a week - this commute has a 400m climb each way, single track wi lots of stopping/starting on the return leg. I’ve looked at a few of the less expensive options and I’m a wee bit unsure of how well they’ll do on the uphills and whether there’s any prospect of battery regen on the way down the hills ? 
 
We’re all in on this change, it’s something we should’ve done some time ago but we cannot wait to get into it.

It was a pain in the neck in my ICE vehicles, (DS3 1.2, Alfa Brera 3.2, Guilietta 1750tbi, Citroen C5 V6 auto and a VW Camper) due to the endless gearchanging and speed variation from below 20 to around 45.  
 
However I recently have driven the south road from Cladich to Ford and on to Ardern a couple of times in the Leaf and it was very pleasant. Smooth, always in the correct gear (as there is only the one!) and effortless, with the 1pedal mode avoiding the need to use the brakes.

First 10ish miles are more or less flat on a narrow twisty A road. Going much slower than previously but range holding steady. Next bit is around 5 miles uphill. Going gently and maybe 20-25 miles of range down. The following downhill section recovers around 10 miles of range before levelling out for the final 3 miles. 
 
All good then, just going quite slowly is fine. Getting the charging point installed next week. Looks like I can do comfortably 2 round trips on around a 80% charge without worrying about it. 
 
My wife was due to take delivery of a model 3 Tesla in the next week or so but as expected they’re now saying it’ll be 7 weeks - and the shipment has not left China yet. We’re aware of the covid related port delays so even 7 weeks sounds optimistic imo.

"I was having a think about the subtle and not so subtle ways car manufacturers are trying to hold back the sale of EVs. Some I think is deliberate, others a happy coincidence they won't do anything about. 
 
Toyota: Adverts showing how you don't need to use a charger if you have a hybrid. Also calling the Lexus NX300h a ‘self charging hybrid’ inferring benefits of EV without charging hassle. Miss-direction by going down the H2 fuel cell route. Terrible EV mileage on the plug in Prius (compliance car). 
 
Nissan: Holding back on larger batteries and quirky 'marmite' design. 
 
VW: Advertising the GTE with the ICE as giving you the 'exciting' boost, inferring that 'boring' electricity does the rest. Selling the eGolf with only 80miles of range (BTW 2 blokes in their garage created a 200mile version). Uninformed sales staff who will redirect you away from EVs. eTron with terrible EV miles (compliance car). 
 
BMW: Quirky i3 design, high servicing costs, lobbying Hong Kong Govt away from EV only sales incentives 
 
Kia Soul: Quirky design, low range 
 
Fiat: The Chairman pleading with people not to buy the eFiat500. 
 
GM: Not following on from the Ampera in a serious way in the U.K. Where is the Bolt? 
 
Hyundai: Pricing the IONIQ plug-in hybrid $5k lower than the EV (How does an extra ICE drivetrain cost less than an extra 19kWh of batteries?) 
 
All manufacturers: 
Blinding/distracting consumers with 'jam tomorrow' concept cars. 
Software limiting acceleration (EVs cannot be seen to beat their expensive cash cows, can they?). 
Paying 'think tanks' or funding research to show EVs as producing more brake and tire dust. 
High servicing costs relative to work involved. 
Long lead build times in spite of high demand (eg ZOE 6 months, ICONQ 8-10 months, Golf GTE taken off market). 
 
 
What/who have I missed?",2017,11,16
Lexus. Advertising their hybrids as Self Charging!,2017,11,16
"Hyundai - coming out with a decent EV but producing so few of them that demand is not met. 
 
This is infuriating as without the contracts for supply a large planned production run would bring, the battery manufacturers (eg LG and Samsung in SK) can't invest in larger battery production facilities which would bring further economies of scale. 
 
And it all hangs off a number (the run size) some exec comes up with in a board room. In the very same board room same execs no doubt discuss the real threat of Tesla eating their lunch.

YTD as of last November, VW had made and sold over 18,000 e-Golfs in Europe, only behind the Leaf, Zoe, i3 (mostly Hybrids) and the Outlander. 
 
If you want to accuse VW of dragging their heels around BEV production, then you should really be questioning anybody other than Nissan and Renault too.

"This is tricky because some of my favourites are ICE cars and unlikely to ever come back as EV so I have to be  really  careful with the ‘classic’ 
 
""Supercar"" - surely has to be Taycan with all the trimmings. Not that interested in the cross turismo. 
 
Daily hack - Tesla 3LR/YLR or maybe a BMW i4 40. come from BMW 4 series/3 coupe so its familar but the Tesla is a really nice place to be day to day so I’ll stick with that. Drive a 3LR now but Y might be fun. 
 
City car - Fiat 500e la prima. Just cute as a button and pretty decent range. Happy to have this as a second car right now if it wasn’t for the fact my wife hates them   
 
Classic conversion - shortlist : lotus Exige, Mazda MX-5, Subaru Impreza STI, Skyline GTR-R34, Ferrari 355/360/430.  
 
 Subaru - so much of that experience was the boxer burble which I’d lose, so off the list 
 Ferrari - I think same, lack of noise drops it 
 Lotus Exige maybe a little too hands on so would lose something in the transition 
 So Mazda MX-5 or Skyline GTR-R34. I think Mazda tips it as the R34 is probably of its time in the 90s and the Mazda would be fun as a daily runabout and weekend track car

"Do EV’s need a start button? Tesla for example don’t use one. Is it just a legacy item going back to ICE days?  
 
Why not design all EV’s without the start button and save on hardware and unneeded additional steps?  
What value does the start button actually add? If all EV’s just switched to ready mode when all security was met - e.g. key detected, foot on brake, wouldn’t that be far easier? 
It would also mean that the issues of running down the 12v by not engaging the HV pack would not happen. Perhaps I’m missing something but it seems like the start button is just a familiar item as is the auxiliary function, but it all seems a bit dated now.",2022,2,10
Yes - good point. You don’t necessarily need a start/stop button to reboot in the event of an issue though - again Tesla use the steering wheel buttons if you do need to reboot. 🙂,2022,2,10
"I found the start button lets you change menu settings that you can only do with the car switched on. In my id.3 I pressed the start button without pressing the brake pedal to continue downloading a software update while sat in the car. 
 
I am sure there must be other things you can change only with the car switch on.",2022,2,10
"Over a drive, having a start/stop button on our Zoe adds one key press compared to our Tesla. You have to press the start button before you can engage drive. When you stop, I always press the park button on the Tesla, on the end of the right stalk, which moves to park mode and engages the parking brake. Pressing the stop button on the Zoe does the same thing, so no more actions there. 
 
On the Zoe, pressing and holding the Start button, without a foot on the brake, turns on continuous auxiliary 12v power, which is a useful capability. You have to go into a menu on the Tesla to do that. 
 
Personally, I'd like more buttons and stalks on the Tesla. The single touch screen is liveable with, but the ergonomics are not as good as a well laid out dash with physical controls in my opinion. You can't find the virtual buttons on a touch screen by touch only / muscle memory. No wiper stalk ... bah.",2022,2,10
That’s interesting. I’m not familiar with the iD3. Can’t you just switch the car to ready mode and do all those things? Why do you need to switch on without touching the brake?,2022,2,10
"It's an interesting point. My wife hated the way the Tesla just started up without doing anything, and hated the column switch just as much. When looking for an EV for her she was adamant that she wanted both a start/stop button and a ""proper"" gear lever. The latter I tend to agree with, even after nearly a year the push button drive/reverse/park buttons on the I-Pace seem slightly awkward - a small selector lever would have been more intuitive, I think. Certainly the selector in her Zoe seems more intuitive to use, but some of that may be because I drove a succession of Prius's over a decade or so, that had a similar sort of selector..",2022,2,10

"I'm old fashioned enough to think EVs should have a crank handle! Let's take the good lessons from the past. Need to start your car with a flat battery? Then just give the crank handle a work-over.

The battery routinely went flat (thinking about it retrospective, it probably just needed a new battery but the old git was too tight), never had a problem starting it though?!",2022,2,12
"Does the tyre-inflator that runs off the 12V aux socket have a flex long enough to reach all 4 of the tyres on an ID.3? Please do check & let us know! If too short, that's a potential safety-failure of VW, and the inflator should go back to them to have a longer flex fitted imho.",2022,2,12

Still waiting for someone here to double-check the reach, though!

"Hi all, 
 
Just got a new job which will involve 3 x 40 mile commutes per week so looking at an EV as I don't fancy putting the miles on (or spending that much time in) my Clio 200 track toy. 
 
Wife will also use the EV for her 10 mile commute on the 2 days I don't use it. 
 
So basically the car will just be used for lots of short journeys, so range isn't really a concern, however the more the merrier of course. About the furthest I could ever see me taking it would be to visit family 50 miles away. I have other cars I would use for longer journeys. 
 
Considerations: 
 
 I can charge for free at work (just off a 3 pin plug however, but I'm there 8 hours each day) 
 I will be charging off a 3 pin plug at home also (Have access to 2 other cars so not mega worried about getting into a situation where the car cant be used because it hasn't finished charging) 
 Rural commute, avg speed 50mph. 
 Budget 10-15k but am flexible. Want something that isn't going to kill me in depreciation. 
 Warranty would be nice, but surely these EV's are reliable? Wishful thinking probably. 
  
 
Things I would really like (although none are deal breakers): 
 
 Ability to pre-heat the car remotely. 
 Small footprint so I can park/charge it in a typical UK garage. 
 Folding mirrors to help with the above point. 
 I'm a bit of a geek so would like the ability to remotely connect to the car to check state of charge etc (not sure if this is even a thing). 
  
So far the main consideration was a BMW i3 or i3S... because I am at heart a petrol head, and would love something that has some fun factor... however from looking around today I see EV's do seem to be plunging in price. Some very low mileage/new Zoe's seem to be available for under £15k, as well as many other options I probably haven't looked into. 
 
Would love to hear people's thoughts/suggestions.",2023,6,1

"Hi 
I have had my  Sync.24.7 charger installed on my driveway at home and am very happy with it. However, I have stumbled across a problem regardiing the charge cable. 
 
Once the cable is in place and charging has commenced the cable is locked into the car and the wall. Once the charge is complete and the led flashes Yellow to indicate so, the tether unlocks from the wall. if you remove the cable fromthe wall you can then remove ot from the car, without your keys and with the car locked. 
 
My charging is usaully complete at 2am therefore after 2am anyone can remove the cable and walk off with it without any problem. These cables cost around £100 to replace and I doubt it will take long before the light fingered members of our society will work out that if a yellow flashing light is clearly displayed then the cable is there for the taking. 
 
I have contacted Sync  EV.24.7 regarding this issue and to date have not received a responce. 
 
Please tell me there is a setting that I'm missing to secure the cable post charge that will ensure the cable can not be removed so I can turn off my alarm setting for 2am and sleep through the night.",2022,5,5

"Yeah - my iD3 won’t allow the cable to be removed until I unlock the car.

I am - after ten months - very happy with it 😂",2022,5,5
"The Zappi can be set to lock the cable in all the time and require a PIN to release it. A good idea if your worried, I have a T1 car and that is not locked at the car end.

"There's no cable lock on the SyncEV charger, you can pull the cable out while it's charging if you wanted to (NOT advisable). It's up to the EV to decide what it does in a power failure, mine won't unlock without the car being unlocked even if it's unplugged. 
 
It's not just the cables being unplugged, I've heard occasions where tethered cables have been cut off a wall box, probably much more costly to replace. I suggest you get down screwfix and get a wall anchor point and chain the cable to the wall if you're worried about it being pinched.",2022,5,5

"i have a problem. The problem is I love cheap sports cars, having owned Nissan 350z's and Toyota Celicas in the past, but after following climate change science I've decided to reduce my carbon emissions as much as possible and there doesn't seem to be very much on the market to fill the gap. I have my zero emission Leaf which is brilliant, but it's obviously not sporty. And if you do drive it briskly you end up at a charge point sooner than expected  . I'd love to buy a Tesla (roadster or model S), but they are outside of my price range especially as a second car. i3 Rex is a possibility, but it's not really designed as a sports car and a bit on the expensive side for what I'm thinking of.  
 
It's a shame toyota didn't put a tuned Prius 1.8L hybrid system in a new Celica or Mazda/Honda couldn't do something with a range extender In their small sports cars. I've always fancied an American muscle car such as the Mustang they are bringing over here this year, but I'm guessing it's not going to be less than 50g/km!

"I have a cash budget of between £28 and £36 max. No intention to buy with finance, this will be a cash purchase from my savings. I am an active retiree, just sold my Nissan Leaf 40kwh that I have enjoyed over the past two years. My driving is mainly local up to say 60 miles return, with longer journeys a few times a week of up to 160 miles or a tad further. So basically help me with my options. Your views and opinions will be valued. 
 
 
So, first option another Leaf. Possibly a secondhand 62kwh E Plus at 26k. But I have owned a Leaf for over two years now and really fancy a change. How about an ID3 ? Yes, but new they are £35k for the poverty spec Life model and £35k is close to a price of a secondhand high mileage Model 3. Maybe bust my budget and buy an early 2019 Model 3 then, but with all my funds spent to the max then I would be living off bread and water….. 
 
Then there is the new Cupra Born, priced from £34k new. Better spec than the ID3 at a cheaper price. How about a used early Model S, seen some of these on Autotrader priced at £32k. But that could be a risky purchase with no warranty. If anything went pop then with no cash funds left I would be up shit creek, in a leaking boat, with no paddle. Lastly, here is a wild card. The Peugeot e2008. Drove a 2020 GT line model a few days ago,priced at £29k. Absolutely loved it, lovely interior, good ride,loads of kit,in many ways I liked it better than the ID3.

Prices are crazy at the moment for used cars so it's a bad time to buy. if you can wait that would get some cost out, If you buy new you are looking at 2023 or later delivery depending on what you order. It really is down to your use case depending on what will work for you, If you're happy to break your long journey with a charging stop then that opens up other models with less range and more choice. There will be lower cost cars from chinese vendors in the UK soon one of them may meet your needs at a lower price point. Will this be your last new car? that opens up another set of considerations. You need some better criteria must have, nice to have and don't care list out the key attributes from you're use case and go from there.",2022,4,7
"Thanks for the replies. I think with the id3 that buying new is not a good idea, especially as the Cupra Born is better specified and also a tad cheaper. I looked on Autotrader to see if there were any used id3 reasonably priced but prices start at a stiff £34 for an early 70 plate. I did briefly test drive a Kermit green launch edition Mokka E last summer and liked it. Loved the colour and the interior. Made in Germany by  Opel.That is a possible option secondhand at circa £28.

Regarding a Mini e or Honda e I think for me the range would be too limiting, especially having owned the Leaf 40kwh. I might have a drive of the facelifted MG ZS EV, although I did drive the earlier version last year and felt my Leaf 40kwh was a better car overall especially regarding handling. 
 
At the moment ID3 prices are crazy. Some on Autotrader are priced more then a Tesla. 
 
I thought the ID3 was a mass market car, not an expensive niche product. Thanks to black_amp for your thoughts. I have also thought about waiting till next year and bide my time till the Chinese start to market here with more affordable cars ( Ora Cat ? ).

"I would suggest trying all the Korean EVs, the 5 or 7 year warranties make them tempting for a start.

Mitsubishi Outlander: gives people what they want - 30 miles EV and an SUV - sales off the scale, can't make enough of 'em. 
 
The big manufacturers just don't want to bother with EVs or even PHEVs in the UK. Sideline companies like Mitsubishi who were losing sales due to their previous focus on gas guzzling SUVs had to do something, and did, and sell lots and lots of them.",2015,10,6

"Hi All, 
 
I've been a member of this forum for around a year now alongside collecting my Golf GTE. I used this forum a lot whilst making the decision on whether to go electric or not, and I'm looking to find people in a similar situation - who haven't yet made their decision to purchase an EV/PHEV. If so, I'd be interested to know, are your reasons contextual, i.e lack of charging infrastructure near you, or psychological?",2019,3,27
"I'm not doing the questionnaire - but my reasons were to save money - I can go 200 miles on less than it takes an ICE to do 10miles or 1 litre. I live next to a petrol station and I haven't stepped onto it or into it for over a year and a half  
 
And I have the clunkyness of any ICE engine these days.",2019,3,27
Agreed a 10th of the price was my reckoning.,2019,3,27
"I haven't bought yet. There are three reasons why: 
 
 I have a car. It still works. It's got almost 80k on it and has never had any work done so it's perfectly fine. Getting something else now seems indulgent, even though its value is going down and it can only be a matter of time before it needs some kind of work. Probably. 
 The options at the moment are really limited. It's getting better all the time, but when a new model's announced there's a massive wait for delivery. It feels like we're definitely heading into an EV future, but we're some way away yet. 
 Cost. While running costs of EVs are a lot lower than petrol guzzlers, there's no getting around the fact that the upfront cost is higher. It feels like paying more for getting less. Properly test driving a Zoe was an eye opener - the experience of it was great, but inside it's as basic as can be.  
 There are ways around all these things. I hate the idea of PCP or similar because if I'm paying for something I'd like to own it, but that model would help.",2019,3,27
"My EV costs around 3p per mile for 'fuel' based on 4 miles per Kw and 12p per Kw on my home tariff. So that would be £6 for the 200 miles mentioned = 3p per mile. 
 
An ICE would use around 4.5 gallons @ £5.50 per gallon for 200 miles = around £24 - or 12p per mile. So that would be 4 times as expensive to fuel an ICE when home electricity is used in an EV instead.",2019,3,27

"I had my eye on an i3 for a year or two and the new battery with bigger range tipped the balance. I had a 3 litre diesel X5, 15 years old. It was too big for what we needed and getting towards end of life. 
 
I was never interested in a hybrid because it is really just a way of reducing running costs without the full benefit of electric. Ditto a range extender.  
 
Difficult to justify the initial cost of an i3 but once I had driven one it changed my mind completely. In fact, a decent EV makes you realise that an ICE is so clunky - noisy, smelly, environmentally unsound.  
 
Contributors to this forum don’t need telling but I have to explain to people that an EV has no oil because there is no engine, it has no water because there is no radiator. Servicing comprises a brake check and not much else. They are near silent at low speeds and will out accelerate all but the very fastest performance cars. But, that’s just my opinion!",2019,3,27

"I've got a Kona on order, but I'm not yet fully committed, though I'm increasingly leaning that way. 
For me it's just a bucket list thing if I'm honest. There's no way it makes financial sense as I don't/won't do the miles. I'd like to claim green creds, but unless after me the car goes to someone who maxes the miles it'll probably have used more energy to build (compared to an equivalent ICE) than the fuel savings. 
But I've become increasingly fed up with ICE - the continuing addition of emission controls is making them complex and 'unreliable', in which I include things like hesitating when the throttle is pressed. It doesn't inspire confidence. (I'm not against such controls  per se , but they do make driving and ownership more difficult.) 
 
We looked seriously at the i3 a few years back, but there were too many gotchas - price, range (the REX looked good at first but as it couldn't maintain motorway speeds it seemed less shiny) and the final killer for us, a three adult family, was the rear door arrangement. 
I was also seriously considering a PHEV, but they just seem a kludge to me - they have most of the advantages of a BEV but also many of the disadvantages of an ICE with a load of extra complications on top. 
 
The arrival of an 'affordable' 250+ mile hatchback was the tipping point for me. The problem I now have is that SWMBO has just found out the price ... I have work to do there ",2019,3,27
"I'm much the same as chanticleer. I own a fully operational ICE that suits my needs and hasn't had any issues in the 85,000kms I've owned it. In NZ we have a very limited range of very expensive vehicles. Anything affordable would still cost a lot and give me very little range. I generally work from home, and any most of the commuting I do into town (7kms each way) I take a small motorcycle. Which leaves mostly countryside driving.  
 
From a purely financial sense, it would be silly to purchase anything now. From an environmental sense I'm just better off planting 15 trees a year on a bit of land I have.

"Wanted to wait until next year for a Zoe 2 with faster 100kWh CCS charging but my dirty diesel Fiesta Zetec Sport let go last month so had to get a replacement car quick and decided life was too short, there is always something better coming and hearing good things about my local Renault Zoe dealer, DSG Morecambe and actually talking to a Zoe owner here in Lancaster decided to take the plunge!  
 
Best car I've ever owned, much faster than the old Fiesta and surprisingly good around the corners despite lack of harder springs and being so high off the ground. More boot space and just better all around. Have managed with the slower charge rate of 22kWh which isn't really that bad, just means waiting 45 minutes instead of 20 mins and I only do long journeys once a month. Home charger ground earths has proved challenging but that's more Chargemasters fault than Renault. Luckily I've had free charging at the local Uni not very far from my house and now the home charger works its happy days! Have now done 2000 miles in first month of ownership ",2019,3,28
"I was aware that the i3 has both oil and water but the oil is like the oil in your ICE back axle - for the most part you wouldn’t know it was there. Ditto water cooling which many large electronic systems have anyway. Compared with oil changes, oil filter changes, oil leaks, radiator antifreeze requirements, water pumps and water leaking from hoses we are talking a different order of magnitude. Then there are exhaust pipes, manifold gaskets etc, etc. How about injector failures, carburettor needles sticking (going back a few years!). Agree there will no doubt be other problems but they are more likely to be electrical/electronic. With good design these failures can be minimised but you can’t easily design frictionless bearings, no-fail gaskets and so on.",2019,3,28
"When I worked at a Kia dealership over a decade ago, I was amazed to think they covered the air con compressor for 7 years. I think most cars' systema lose refrigerant over that time. I read the terms and conditions, finding the air con system was only covered for a year! They had a scale of UP TO 7 years for various components. Not a lot of people knew that. 
We used to get prospective customers in our showroom asking about the warranty duration difference between the 2 Korean sister brands. I could only reiterate that with shared bits underneath, they were as good as each other. 
Both brands were basic back then, but very reliable, with no common faults that needed fixing under warranty.",2019,3,28
"Gosh, you guys in the UK have so many EV options we don't have in the USA. The Zoe sounds like a no-brainer, especially if you buy used. Here the Fiat 500e can be quite cheap used, partly because the Fiat brand is new here. Used i3's and Mercedes B Class Electric all look good used. Leafs are cheap too, but battery degradation is an issue. 
But any EV is much easier as a 2nd car, which is pretty common here. Husbands and wives both work and there's no decent mass transport outside of the big cities. 
The one other factor that has caused many of us to spend way more then it makes sense to spend, is that we want to support Elon Musk and experience what it's like to own a Tesla NOW, not later.

"Considering two EVs: Kia Niro 64 KWh and Skoda Enyaq 60. Test drove both, like them, and would be happy with either.  
 
Concerned about range since it would be our only car without a backup for longer trips. We have a driveway for installing a charging point, which would suffice most of the time.  
 
However, we often need to travel longer distances (150-200 miles, usually at night) to reach airports to visit family abroad with our young kids. This is as likely to be winter as any other time of year. 
 
Wife's colleague says she had issues finding working charging points coming back from airports with a Citroen EC4, but unsure if it's exaggerated.  
 
How is life with an EV in the UK, especially Northern England? Availability and reliability of charging points?",2023,6,21
"Welcome! 
 
I have an eNiro and in answer to your questions I would say don't be worried. There is rapid charging on all the motorway services areas and if you don't want to use those then you may have to drive a few miles extra but you will find somewhere sensible to charge. I have never not been able to charge on a long trip but occasionally it might be a little inconvenient.  
 
Availability... things are getting busier so yes, on occasions there might be a bit of a queue to charge and that could be a problem if you are in a bit of a hurry. I always try to have a backup plan if the charger I get to is occupied. At many service areas now there are many chargers installed so it is becoming less of an issue and overnight it is not likely to be a problem anyway. 
 
Reliability... it very much depends on the charging network. Some... like InstaVolt are almost all working... ones like GeniePoint are almost all NOT working! You will get to know the ones to avoid. If you arrive at a location to find the only chargepoint not working make sure you have a backup within range. I use Zap-Map for planning but there are others such as ABRP. 
 
I have not ever been worried that I wouldn't find anywhere to charge but it can be frustrating sometimes to have to even think about backup plans etc especially if you have kids/pets in tow that really don't want any delays and if that is the case then try to plan your route using main service areas, with multiple chargers from a reliable network... InstaVolt, Ionity, MFG, GridServe are my personal favs but there are others and I am sure other people will chip in. 
 
Always plan to arrive at your next charge location or destination with at least 60 miles still in the ""tank"". Over time you may become happy letting that get lower but I find that always planning 60 miles means that should I get to my next charge location and it is occupied or broken I will have enough to get me to an alternate. 
 
I would say go into it with a degree of flexibility. It won't be perfect and there is a learning curve during which you might make a mistake or two but don't let that put you off... push through that period and you will be rewarded.",2023,6,21
"First, longer journeys with a BEV are still not quite as simple as with a petrol or diesel car. 
 
With that out of the way, it's still generally fine. Work out roughly where you need to charge in advance, and have a few possible locations, ideally hubs with multiple chargers. Use Zap-Map (  EV charging stations & electric vehicles - Zapmap  ) or similar to locate rapid chargers. It soon becomes second nature. There are many other advantages to EV ownership that many of us find compensate for this slight inconvenience. 
 
On your particular car choices...the Niro 64 range is a step up from the Enyaq 60's. With the former you will normally only need to charge once, on your way back from a destination 200 miles from your house (or you could charge on the way there instead, but it's best not to leave the car sat near 100% charge whilst you go on holiday). With the latter, you will normally need to charge twice, once (briefly) on the way there, once (for longer) on the way back.

But before you buy an EV, please download the Zap-map and WattsUp apps on your phone and get an idea of how many chargers there actually are.

initial suggestion would be to use the google maps overlay from this forum that Snax produced -  Charging Hub Locations - Google My Maps   
 
I think it defaults to ‘tesla only’ being off but if not, make sure thats off. That’ll then show you all locations with 5+ chargers in a single place. More likely to have a free one available and not have all of them broken.

Kia have the ability to pay £11.59 a month to get Ionity charging cheaper which if you are using it enough makes sense, not sure about Skoda if they do the same. 
 
As others have said, there are apps out there that manage the route to get to aa couple of options.

"My family are looking to go fully electric by replacing a Yaris with a small EV to complement our Tesla Model S. We've tried the Fiat 500 E and Mini Electric but the current favourite is a 2021 Zoe. 
 
We've been over to the local Renault dealer who have a few low mileage 2021's for sale. So far we've had a quick spin in one of them to check the driveablility, boot space, seating setup etc. but we're going back for another test drive with a reserved car this weekend. 
 
We've had the Tesla since new (6 years) so familiar with the EV experience & have home charging. Living north of the border we're also familiar with finding/using public rapids & have a ChargePlace Scotland card so that side of things should be covered. I'd be interested in any tips/things to look for on a nearly new car, e.g. checking software is up-to-date, battery health (unlikely to be an issue on a newish car?), included accessories (do Renault typically provide a granny charger or Type 2 cable?). 
 
We've had a look at a couple of YouTube reviews so are aware of the lack of side impact airbags but other than that the Zoe looks like an excellent value-for-money proposition. I've also seen this really helpful thread (apologies, there's probably a neater way to link to it!):

At 5 years old and having put 55k on it it had lost one fewer bars than required for a new battery and only had 55 miles useable range left.",2022,5,12

Only very slight niggle would be the rear door handles aren't as easy to use as they could be. Other than that it's a great little car, that seems to be remarkably efficient, too.",2022,5,12
"I test drove one of these last month. It's the perfect size for us and the extra range over things like the Corsa-e, Fiat 500e, etc. is very appealing. The only major obstacle is the fact that our local Renault dealer (where I test drove the car) is a complete arseclown. He made no bones about how much he dislikes EVs and how he thinks it's outrageous that we're all being forced into them. After the test drive, his monologue about how much better things used to be proved so tiresome that I got up and walked out after a few minutes of it. Unfortunately, it's a very small dealership so I'd end up having to deal with him whenever the car needed attention.

"I guess it's worth checking that the supplied cable is genuine (or at least 3-phase like the genuine one). The car won't charge at 22kW on 22kW AC chargers if you use a single-phase cable.

Also, CCS was optional on the GT Line, so if you want that, you need to ensure that the vehicle is an ""R135 GT Line Rapid Charge"" to give it its full title.

On the other hand we’re getting a car that could, on the odd occasion, comfortably do long distance trips and carry adult passengers, and we’re saving a few 1000 quid compared with current competition (Mini, Fiat, Honda - we didn’t test a VW E-up though). 
 
We have everything we wanted on the car we’ve picked with the possible exception of heated seats (we may look at getting an aftermarket retrofit but will see how we get on come the colder months first). 
 
We’ve also ordered a 3 pin charger having found one to be invaluable for trips away in our Tesla. I seem to recall that the Tesla mobile connector does bad things to the Zoe - not sure if this is still the case? but we think a separate charger for the Zoe will be a worthwhile investment.",2022,5,15
"Hi all, I am hoping someone can help me with this. I have had my Megane e-Tech Launch edition for a few months now and even though the weather is much warmer than when I collected the car in January, I noticed that the range is not really improving. I was under the impression that it would change based on several conditions, including the temperature. 
Does anyone know if I need to do anything to reset the range? I cannot see an option to reset it but would really appreciate some help if someone knows what to do. 
Thanks",2023,3,22
"Hopefully someone else will jump in with comment specific to that car, however.... The indicated range of any car is often referred to as the Guess-o-Meter because it's really just that. Based on the battery state of charge and the historic power use per mile/km the GOM will give you a figure that's mathematically correct. 
 
Some manufacturers are better than others at this. Kia/Hyundai seem to be about the best. Stellantis (Vauxhall, Peugeot, Fiat, etc) seem to be about the worst. 
 
I don't know how it works on the Megane but in the Zoe if you reset the trip counter it will cause things to recalculate, but it still isn't immediate. 
 
As weather is warmer and conditions improve you will find you can get a higher miles/kWh from the car and so the indicated range will increase... but it's always a guess.",2023,3,22
"The little switch on the steering wheel which flips between display options that you might see on the right hand side of the binnacle has the function of resetting the trip data if held down for a few seconds. 
It's easiest to see what's going on if you flip it onto the trip display first then after releasing the switch hold it down again for maybe 3 to 5 seconds. 
If you charge to 100% then do that you'll see after a couple of miles driving you'll get a more accurate representation of your efficiency. 
you've not stated what you've been getting so it's anyone's guess as to if you have been doing a grandad or a winston wolfe.

"What use case do you use the car for? 
Lots of short journeys or long ones? 
There are lots of reasons why short journeys are not representative of long run range. One example for example a long run down the motorway at 60mph will warm the battery up making it much more efficient than the same overall distant covered at 30 to 40mph in many trips.  
In the winter I get much better mpkwh doing a longer faster journey than my short trips around town",2023,3,22
What range are you getting? I can get 200 miles if I run it down to Zero in Eco mode on long motorway trips. Shorter commute trips on minor roads in Comfort mode maybe only 180miles. But as I always tell people its not the range you worry about its the charging speed that matters! I only plug in for a few minutes to add enough range to get home normally 🙂,2023,3,22
"I'm seeing definite improvement in predicted range when the car has been sat in warm parking hall the whole day. Even without resetting anything.  
 
Otherwise you could try what Gaz suggested to reset the trip. Also the car should adjust after around 125 miles of driving (200km according to manual, not sure what it is for UK cars).",2023,3,22
"A while ago some muppet was harping on about a portable charge unit to stick in the boot and give 5 or 7 kWh of power in an emergency. 
The design was flawed enough that I bothered to contact them and put forward some ideas which included making it a DC charger rather than wasting time and efficiency converting between ac/dc/ac then the car converting back to DC whilst you sit in the dark wishing you had paid for something with better range or not driven like a twat to impress someone in a car you cannot afford. 
Said muppet refused to listen and attempted to make out I was some sort of stupid c¤◇☆ for suggesting the obvious and tried to state a number of things that were clearly nonsense so I gave up. 
Anyway, a chinese company have produced what some would say cannot be made and it's obviously something to look at even if they will have illegible instructions. Hopefully they'll flood the market and put other inferior product producers out of business so we can snap up bargains for a couple of hundred quid if we are prepared to wait ages for a few measly miles worth of juice.",2023,3,22
"I was getting 180 at first, now getting about 220 on a full charge, without resetting anything yet. I don't think I have changed my driving style over that period either. The miles/kwh figure seems to match up fairly well with the GOM. What range are you getting?",2023,3,23

"With my old Zoe I would always reset the range on long journeys so I would know if I would make my next charge stop or not. 
 
However the Megane estimates how much charge you will have left and I have found it very accurate on the Google maps, so don't reset as often as I used to as I don't need to anymore. 
 
However I have noticed even at Zero percent it still has about 20 miles of range left as proven by Tesla Bjorn. This is a big improvement on the Zoe, as you could never get the full mileage out of the car as you were dipping into its reserve buffer, so always had to keep 10 -12 miles of extra range in hand to prevent it going into limp mode. 
 
That means you can basically drive it down to Zero percent and still have the buffer if you need it, generally I would only recommend doing this on your return journey home as you know you will be able to charge, as long as you have home charging! 
 
As I always do when getting a new EV, I have already run the Megane down to 5% and still had full power available, even though the GOM disappeared at 10 miles remaining to the ""Double Dash"" of mystery! ",2023,3,24

"Hi Guys 
I'm new to the forum and to EVs. I just landed in France and hired a Fiat 500e. It had 78% when I collected it and headed of. Where I was travelling to needed more miles than I had left, so at 35% remaining, I stopped at a service station. After trial and error, I got the charger to work. I put my card in and €49.99 was debited. For my €49.99, I got approx another 25% as it went up to 60% full. This seems like and awful lot of money and much more that the cost of petrol or diesel.  
Is this what EV recharges usually costs? 
 
Thx in advance",2022,5,21
"It's usual to precharge your card to check that it works and funds are available. A short time later (could be hours) the extra money is refunded. It's usually done by reserving an amount which is not actually transferred, then that reservation is dropped after the real payment is transferred. 
You may have received multiple precharges of this sort if you had some false starts. They should all be reset.

"Some folk have reported issues where using a start schedule on the EVSE results in the car not being in a state to accept the charge but one would assume you allow the EVSE to charge a little earlier but set the car to start charging at the time you want with the charge being halted by the schedule on the EVSE. 
Personally, I just plug it in and charge so have not had any of these difficulties except when using an Ohme that tried to defer my charge for an unfathomable reason and somewhat confused the car. 
 
Many people have reported issues where they use both a schedule on the EVSE and the car schedule and find the car isn't charging as they expected but I can only imagine they get it the wrong way round unless the car is doing something rather odd. 
 
For a number of Corsa and Mokka owners a recent update appears to have caused deferred charging problems which hopefully will get fixed soon.

"Given that the limiting factor for EVs at the moment seems to be supply not demand, I'd rather see government mandate a certain percentage of EV sales, rising each year.  
 
Giving an incentive inflates demand which isn't lacking, but mandating a certain minimum number of EVs sold would directly force manufacturers to make more vehicles if they wanted to carry on selling. 
 
Alternatively mandate a certain minimum fleet emissions economy, rising each year. That would have the advantage of being fairly technology neutral at first. Manufacturers could meet it in the early stages through everything from just selling small, fuel efficient ICE vehicles to ballancing gas guzzlers with BEVs, or buying credits from manufacturers selling BEVs. But as the standards become more stringent they'd all have to eventually transition to BEVs.

"Morning all. New e-208 owner joining the discussion.  
 
For the last few years we've adopted a x1 ICE and x1 BEV vehicle strategy. We now use the ICE (VW campervan) for longer trips, weekends away etc, and the BEV (Tesla Model 3 initially then most recently a Model Y) for most day to day and local driving, which accounts for 80% of our driving. We did use the Tesla for longer journeys (south Wales to Scotland or France as examples) but more recently have found charging wait times and subsequent longer journey times to be a regular annoyance. Hence why we default, for now, to the ICE for longer trips. That should be better in a few years when the charging infrastructure has caught up. 
 
We concluded last week that as a result we didn't need a Tesla to cover mostly local day to day driving for the next few years. So, on something of an impulse, we decided to swap it for a smaller, less expensive BEV with lower range. The e-208 won, picked one up a few days ago. £24k for a e-208 GT in Elixir Red. Registered Jan 2023 and with only 300 miles on the clock. So, basically a new car for a considerable discount off list. Further research tells me this is one of those 2022 models (range 225 miles) being cleared before the arrival of the refreshed version with slightly more power/range. Suits us perfectly though. 
 
First impressions are very positive indeed! 
 
Things I like more than the Tesla experience: 
 
 The e-208 looks lovely, nicely designed inside and out. 
 The drive in the e-208 is more refined. Much better suspension. And quieter. 
 More comfortable seats. 
 Apple Carplay is available. 
 Digital cockpit - good to have dials in front of me again. 
 Some buttons for simple controls. 
 Auto wipers work. 
 Door handles (inside and out) that I don't have to explain to people how they work. 
 A glovebox I can open without navigating a touchscreen (OK the glovebox is tiny  ) 
 Being back in a small hatchback is nice, much more town and car park friendly. 
 Insurance is less than half the price of insuring the Tesla 
  
A few things that the Tesla wins on: 
 
 Range, obviously, it was a Model Y Long Range that could comfortably do 250 miles. 
 Ability to set a maximum state of charge, I used to set the Tesla at 80% max when charging overnight. Quite surprised I can't do that on the Peugeot. 
 Speed. Even the LR has ridiculous acceleration. I'm no boy racer though so can take it or leave it. 
 App just worked. Less steps to get it connected to the car and just leave it. Mobile as car key also good. 
 Heated seats. Didn't get them on the e-208, I gather they are an additional option. 
 Dog mode in the Tesla was regularly used. 
 Storage space, Model Y is obviously much bigger. But the e-208 boot is big enough for our spaniel so fine. 
 Frunk to carry charging cables 
  
Overall, very happy with the change, always had a liking for little French hatchbacks and the e-208 seems a very good example of exactly that. It really is good to drive and pretty quick too.",2023,5,2
"Good stuff interbear. 
 
Dog mode... I had to google that. Clever idea, but possibly still not legal in the uk? 
 
I drag our labrador around in the boot of a e208 no problem, though in hot weather I put the back windows down a bit for air circulation. 
 
Two things I've learned that you might find useful: 
 
 live traffic is on a subscription that expires 3 years after registration (though I imagine Teslas are more subscriptiontastic so you're probably expecting this). 
 Peugeot will give you a paper log book if you ask, but your salesman (if like ours) might say ""oh all maintanence is logged electronically now so there's no paper log book"". The paper log book is better in my opinion as this frees particularly the post 3 year driver from using a Peugeot garage for servicing (as independent garages can't access Peugeot's electronic maintenance logs) 
",2023,5,2
"I asked Peugeot customer service about charging to 100% and got this reply 
 
""I would like to inform you that charging your vehicle up to 80% is recommended to preserve the battery life of your e 208 vehicle also a charge when the vehicle is above 10% is recommended rather than waiting for it to be under 5%. Of course, that doesn't mean the battery won't wear out over time but it will help towards the longevity of the battery life. "" 
 
They did also answer by phoning and I got the feeling that the person on the other end didn't really know much about EVs (ie understand that the e208 has quite a large buffer), so I wouldn't completely trust this advice.  
 
That said, charging to 80% ish works for me as I mostly do short journeys, so I do follow their advice, and just guesstimate the number of hours charge required on my Zappi (also using Octopus Go). If I'm going on a long journey I am not afraid to charge to 100% and take advantage of the cheap electrons. 
 
I'll post a dog guard picture a bit later.",2023,5,2
"We have an e-208 in the family (almong with a Tesla M3 RWD, a M3 LR and a Fiat 500e) and my understanding is that, like the Fiat, it is fine to charge to an indicated (but not actual) 100% because of the inaccessible buffer, presumably there to protect the battery. 
 
Surely Peugeot would give a straightforward way to charge to 80% (I'm unaware of one) if this was necessary/recommended best practice?",2023,5,2

During our last trip I made a concerted effort to plug the car in at every services we visited and I'm pleased to say that across Belgium, Germany and Austria we were able to activate AC chargers without issue. Adding CCS and bringing Ionity into the mix means I'm not concerned about finding chargers as they're plentiful along the E40 in Belgium, the A3 that takes us across Germany and the route across Austria.  
 
What does worry me slightly is how  often  we'll need to stop... My test drive gave me a chance to loosely measure consumption at about 220wh/km in mild, 14-degree conditions doing 70-75mph, but I'm not sure what range to expect of the car with the heat pump running with thicker air to power through in 0-3 degree temperatures... Would 100 miles of range be achievable ingreen mode and at a reduced speed of 120km/h/75mph?  
 
Obviously only time will tell, but I'd be interested to hear the winter motorway range experiences of owners on this forum to have a rough idea of how many stops the trip will truly require, otherwise it may just be all too hard and require the plane!",2021,10,26
"We've yet to use ours in winter yet, but you'd be better looking at reducing your speed to say 65mph to avoid heavy consumption. Then should be good for 100 miles according to most feedback on the ""Mini Electric UK"" FB group (which I recommend you join). 
 
Also, best is to precondition the car before you leave, whilst plugged in (and set to charge), for maximum range benefit.",2021,10,26
"I wouldn't fancy a ten charge trip - it sounds the wrong car for the job. Would it not be better to hire something? 
Also, on the tortoise and the hare principle, would you not get there faster door to door by dropping your speed to increase your range and cut out at least one charge per day? If a 10% to 90% charge takes an hour, would cutting your speed from 75MPH to 65MPH give you sufficient extra range to be able to ""only"" make 4 stops?",2021,10,26
"In theory, you might have ""100miles"". In practice you dont for a few reasons. 
 
Firstly, you generally dont rapid charge back to 100%. Charging slows significantly above 80% and its almost never worth taking it past 90. 
 
Secondly, you never run it down to 0%, because you always want to keep a bit of a buffer to get to an alternative charger etc. Depending on route that buffer might even be 10 or 15miles of range at the bottom end. 
 
Thus while the car might have ""100miles"" of range, you need to stop after 80miles the first time, and then because you've only charged to 80%, your subsequent stops are closer together still. 
 
Lastly, the chargers never quite line up where you need them, so you might find you have 80miles of range, but the chargers are either 70miles, or 90miles away. Clearly you end up having to stop at 70miles instead. 
 
 
I also suspect that 100miles in winter is not actually realistic for a car with <30kwh of energy, and certainly not if your trying to do 75mph. If your happy to take a leisurely jaunt across the country stopping every hour, then sure, its probably doable, but that doesnt seem to fit with your premise of ""aiming to get from A to B as fast as possible """,2021,10,26
"Thanks all - it's not a complete deal-breaker for us as we can and, 3-4 times throughout the year will, usually fly. It's more a case of guesstimating whether it'll take 10 stops or 12-14, I guess. Having a rough idea of what to expect on winter range wouldn't hurt, either, and I guess I'm going to have to learn that 65mph = faster than 75mph. Goodbye PHEV life! At the end of the day, given recent changes in our personal circumstances, there probably won't be instances where we couldn't turn it into a bit of a jolly if that was our only choice and we had a compelling reason to take the car.",2021,10,26
"It’s much the same (almost identical in fact) powertrain as the i3 and unless you stick to 65 mph maximum on motorways your range is going to be a bit less than 90 miles in winter, charging is not an issue as that powertrain will easily charge to 90% before slowing down. 
 
But basically….definitely the wrong car for your journey with your required “as fast as possible”.",2021,10,26
Here is the charge curve for the 94ah i3….so expect the Mini to be simila.,2021,10,26
"Yes, out the three options, I would always much rather drive. I find the whole experience of flying, airports, plane passengers, security, getting to the airport etc incredibly stressful, not to mention the environmental concerns. 
 
Train could be nice if the journey was broken up and it was more of a sight seeing trip rather than a A-B trip with the aim of spending most time at the end destination. 
 
Driving, even with traffic hold ups etc, is just by far the most civilised and convenient option IMO, and now with EVs it can be done with less guilt. Being able to pack a car with what you need on your door step, then get in it and go, can’t easily be matched.",2021,10,27
"Not trying to derail your thread, but unless you have your hearts and mind set on the Mini, have you looked at other cars with better range and similar size and money, such as the Fiat 500e or the Zoe? They are not as fun to drive as the Mini but more practical, range wise. The Fiat also has 85kW DC, and also is extremely efficient.",2021,10,27
"I am currently with elmo and echo the above, I think the only thing that is making me consider switching is the range of vehicles available, but after speaking to their team I think we will see this change soon. I believe some choice from Hyundai will join their offer which is good to hear. (Would love to see something like the Enyaq too if you're reading this team Elmo!) 
 
It's all very simple with Elmo and no hassle with the app like  On.to due to getting a real key. 
 
Pricing between the 2 is pretty much the same with the Zoe, I have the extra £10 a month for the BP fuel card as it works for me. 
 
Good luck in your decision but I'm sure you will be pleased with either choice.",2021,3,28
"I would like to see something bigger in the range and just a better choice. One of the reasons subscriptions like this makes sense is to be able to change when you want/need. Elmo currently only have the MG ZS as another option and although it is slightly bigger it has poor range. 
 
Having choice is what appeals to me now. With the ID3, ID4 out now, XC40 from volvo (ridiculously expensive on their sub platform), Enyaq on its way this summer along with the Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 at some point. So much choice 😁 and I want a platform I can use to explore all of these options or at least as many as I can.",2021,3,28
"Elmo don’t seem to be growing as fast as ONTO did back when they were where Elmo is now. I agree with the comments above about better CS from Elmo. That was also the case with evezy (as ONTO were called at the time) when they had a fleet of less than 100 vehicles. Now they have more than 2000 subscribers it isn’t as easy to give that personal service. They need to up their game though, and hopefully they will. Choice is important too, and ONTO had a better range of vehicles even from the get go. Elmo need to address this, as if you want a Kona, you’d have to go to ONTO even if you didn’t like the fact that you wouldn’t get the key. At the moment the two are only really competitors with Zoe ZE50s.",2021,3,28
"So I never heard back from Karshare in over two weeks now, so here's the abridged responses I got from them initially - questions to them in Bold: 
 
 
Karshare take a percentage to cover the cost of the technology. Is this in addition to the 30% that Karshare retain of the rental cost or is it part of the 30%? 
 
–  This is in addition to the 30%. In the beginning there is a 50/50 split until the technology cost is covered, returning to 70/30 in your favour thereafter.   
 
 
You mentioned that you would need both keys initially, as I have one and Elmo has the other. I can't drive my car without the key. How would this work? 
 
 – We would request the spare key from Elmo, this will be sent to be build into our Karshare Go technology. Your current key will remain completely unaffected.  
 
  
 
If someone borrows my car and it starts with a full charge (100%) and returns it with 10%, how is the cost to the borrower calculated? Would I need to prove how many kWh I had used to get back to 100%, or how much I'd spent, or both?  
 
 – The KarshareGo technology has the ability to read the vehicles telemetry, power level and mileage is read via the technology at the beginning and end of the rental. We obtain the battery size from data obtained from DVLA and other sources giving the total kWh for that battery this is converted into a percentage. Each missing % at the end of the rental is charged to the renter at 20p per kWh. This is passed back to the owner on top of their earnings.  
 
  
 
Does the car need to be offered with a certain charge level for hires? Such as at 80%? 90%? or does it need to sit at 100% all the time?  
 
 – Our usual policy is that vehicle needs to be returned with the same level of fuel or energy as they picked it up with. In the interesting of wanting to encourage more EVs and more EV users, it would be advisable to offer a full charge to allow a renter the maximum benefit of an EV. 
 
  
 
Is there a possibility for Tiers? So if the owner offers their car for the 15 Days as recommended, the owner gets the 70% of the hire cost. If 10 days you get 60% of the hire cost, 5 days 50% etc etc? 
 
  – This is an interesting concept and certainly, one worth exploring, the 15 days are currently there to guide the best rental opportunity for both ends.  
 
  
 
How does Karshare recommend people re-charge the cars they are borrowing? 
 
  – EVs are an interesting use case for Karshare and we are willing to learn and understand the best ways to manage these. As above our system can identify the missing charge and simply charge the renter for what has been used. This is passed back to the owner of the vehicle on top of their earnings. This would also depend on the type of journey the renter is completing, if they are making a significant trip then charging will become a necessity during the booking if they are making a small journey. This would use significantly less charge, I would be very interested to speak with you about this. 
 
  
 
Could you look in to an all inclusive charging package for hirers, such as what Elmo do with the BP Pulse Subscription, where £10 a month gives unlimited BP Pulse access to chargers? 
 
  – Yes absolutely, this would a great benefit.  
 
  
 
What if the car owner leaves the car available but it's not booked? 
 
– The owner is able to set ‘preparation time’ this is the time ‘from now’ needed before a booking can take place, meaning that owners do not lose access to their car. This can be set from 1 to 24hours. This way they can still benefit from the vehicle and not lose out on income. 
 
 
 
I then went back to Karshare and mentioned: 
 
If customers didn't return the car with the same charge as when it left, 20p/kWh was quite low and not a deterrent at all. It costs 25p/kWh at BP Pulse Fast Chargers, more at Rapids, so if customers knew it would save them at least 5p/kWh to let the owner do it, why wouldn't they? Even if I could charge at home, my Electricity rate is 16p/kWh (Bulb) so almost not worth the hassle. 
 
On the same vein, someone who relied on Public Charging would be at a loss if Karshare gave them 20p/kWh but it cost them 25p/kWh (I also mentioned Charging Losses and that actually adding 50kWh might actually require 55kWh). Plus I mentioned the time it can take as well - my Zoe is 8 hours to fully charge from Empty on a 7kW. So why would a hirer spend at least 90 minutes charging my car when for no penalty to them I'd have to do it instead? 
 
 
I then mentioned the over-mileage charge - worst case scenario if someone borrowed my car and then went 250 miles, and it pushed me 250 miles over my monthly mileage with Elmo, I would make £20 from the hire, yet at 12p/mile I would have to pay Elmo £30 in over-mileage charges. You would have to limit the hire to 180 miles just to break even. Imagine if someone went 250 Miles 15 Times - the excess mileage charge would be £450 for that month! 
 
 
 
But I didn't hear back.",2021,3,29
"I based in London and quotation for 1000miles including charging is 437, so nearly £40 more than  on.to",2021,3,29

"I managed to use one of the ultra rapid hubs from MFG today. Quite good I have to say. Easy, with roof coverage for bad weather. Had to register the plate inside but I believe the minimum time it’s being extended to avoid conflict with the chargers. 
Even though they are 150kW I got 40kW on the Zoe, which is a good as it gets I guess. 40% up in a quick 🚽 and 🥤 break, much better than the old ZE40 in that sense, although still needs to improve.",2021,3,30

I liked the look of Elmo, particularly having a key, but I was put off by the delivery charge & admin fee. Not that they're 'unreasonable', but they certainly look hefty compared with Onto - particularly for someone up here in Newcastle.  
 
You seem to be offering more of a modular 'build your own package' approach, and I can certainly see myself using that. 
 
Both services - Onto and Elmo - have left me scratching my head a bit about what's included. Maybe because they're both young and policies are evolving. Precise details on mileage rollover, granny cable (which seems to be free on request or chargeable, depending on who you ask), EU driving, the Karshare. All involved a bit of guesswork and forum sleuthing.",2021,4,8

Just a quick question, does the Paua app/ card offer a discounted rate at the chargers? or it is just an 'all in one' app grouping a few networks together? 
I'm with Octopus energy and have signed up for their Electroverse card which I believe does apply a small discount, just wondered if Paua was the same? 
 
Thanks.",2023,4,3
"@Danny88  word of advice. If you use the Paua/elmoCharge card, download the Paua app and keep an eye on what you spend on it. Just been emailed (for the second time) saying I owe elmo money for my charging which is over what I have actually used with my elmoCharge card.",2023,4,6
"Received my MG ZS through Elmo and loving it so far. 
Just been looking through the thread and can see a few people have recommended Insurance4carhire to cover the excess, however I've taken the ElmoSave option and 'tied in' for a year. 
 
Looking at Insurance4Carhire it's for a 60 day hire period maximum, so I'm assuming this would only be valid on the ElmoFlex option? / anyone on ElmoSave taken out the cover?",2023,4,18

"Still getting used to my new Niro 4 and don't seem to be able to get the cabin heater working properly. Some journeys it doesn't produce any heat until after about 15 - 20 minutes driving and even then the temperature output is modest, even with the dial cranked up to max.  Have tried leaving it on ""Auto"" (as advised by salesman) and also using the manual settings with all permutations of air direction and fan speed. My wife's Fiat 500e get toasty after a couple of minutes so am I doing wrong something with the Niro or is the heater faulty?",2023,3,22
"I understand there are 3 levels of auto on the Niro EV. So try using level 3 perhaps? 
Also, are you driving the car in ECO mode? That reduces the energy used by the heater system. Try Normal driving mode perhaps? 
The Climate Control system will also apply less energy to the cabin heater use as the outside air temperatures rise (and the sun is out strongly, the sun energy is measured directly in real time via a solar detector on top of the dashboard). HTH Peter",2023,3,22
"I think the Niro heating is quite sophisticated and non-trivial in how it works. I've noticed that if I drive like a lunatic and accelerate and regen heavily, I will get a surge in heat delivery, which makes me think the system is scavenging waste heat from the motor and power electronics, and ""topping"" up as necessary with resistive heating. But I think the algorithm controlling the resistive heater must be more complicated than ""It's cold, turn the heater on"".",2023,3,22
"Where you don't get what you ""expect"" from the heating on Auto, press the Climate icon on the Infotainment screen and manually turn on Heat and direct airflow as you wish from the various options/icons displayed. 
 
If doing that still means the car doesn't get warmer then I would humbly suggest you need to talk to your dealer and get them to check the HVAC system. There were early reports of issues with HVAC and some had newer firmware applied and indeed some had some hardware swaps. 
 
No point in trying to live with things if you have a brand-new car not working as you expect. That is what the warranty is for.",2023,3,22
"Previous posts have mentioned this but here’s the skinny and what worked for me and others. On entering the car manually increase the blowers to max level (not ‘windscreen clear mode’) for about 10 seconds. Then hit the auto button to whatever level you’re comfortable with.  
Doing this a couple of days in a row early on seemed to kick start my heating and it’s been great since. I keep my temp at 21 and on ECO and even then get a decent amount of heat ( no heat pump on my car ) very early on in my drive. Normal mode vs ECO mode defo makes a difference and particularly with the strength of the blowers and I’d advise moving out of ECO mode if you need to clear your windscreen quicker.",2023,3,22

"I am really peeved by this change. I had been mulling over options to replace a 2013 Passat diesel estate and had (slightly reluctantly having never bought a new car in my life!) decided on a Skoda Enyaq with the small battery that crept under the £35k limit. At that point I called the dealer and found out about the 8 month waiting list, so held off - now this...   
 
The government's logic here is flawed - with two kids, domestic holidays and loads of stuff to chuck around we need a large family car, but there is literally nothing on that list that will do the job for us. As a result we will probably have to go for a petrol hybrid instead which I'd rather not buy but makes far more economic sense given how our mileages have dropped. If they are serious about getting the mainstream to switch to pure EVs they should be basing discount on the car you are replacing or saying each family unit can have a PICG of X to put against any pure EV of their choice. This change plus the removal of the charger grant in March is going to put off a lot of buyers like us who were about to go electric in the coming year.",2021,12,22

Ideally five door as she ferries “old people” to and from church but this isn’t a deal breaker.  
Skoda Fabia size or smaller. 
She mostly does local journeys up to 100 miles round trip. Unlikely to do longer journeys but if she did she could hire an ICE if she felt she couldn’t handle charging in the wild.

Of those, none have much space in the back, so a slightly larger car would probably be better.

Atm there's only a few decent EVs like the EV6/Ioniq 5 (Or the new sister Genesis GV60) or the e-Niro/Kona 
 
VWs ID3/4 is pretty dull let's be honest. Cupra Born is more interesting. Skoda Enyaq worth a look value wise.

"It always astounds me that people take umbrage to a dealership or car aales lot adding 15-20% to the price they gave you in p/x, they're businesses, not charities. Until you get under £10k, most people are more comfortable spending at a business than private sale, with finance options available. 
 
As always, it's the cost to change that really matters and selling via Motorway usually yields a bigger value for the outgoing car than the local dealership or WBAC coming in at a reasonable price and then chipping you down on everything that would be considered normal wear and tear by anyone's standards. 
 
I've had 16 new VAG cars and used to getting a 15% discount. In current climate, everyone's paying RRP,but the used prices are silly. We sold a 2018 and a 2019 Polo GTI+ a year apart, and we got £2500 more for the 2019 one last May when we chopped it in for our ID3 Family Pro Perfornance, even though both were dot on 2 years old when we got rid of them. That's the current shortage effect.",2022,4,12
"Nearly new ICE cars are commanding good money due to the parts shortages - its effecting all cars. Its not right to say oy EV used prices are seeing aniift due to chronically small pool of used cars. 
 
Financially, it makes no sense to go EV if you can't charge at home on a cheap overnight rate. For those without an off-street parking and the ability to park at home, there's no fuelling savings to be had. After everyone with off street parking has moved to EV willingly, almost everyone else will have a gun to their head to do so, come 2030.",2022,4,12
"Hello, 
 
New here. Have wanted to go EV for many years and thinking of taking the plunge around tax time, 2020. 
 
I've even thought about trying to find a working used Citi/Commuta car!! 
 
I'm thinking 2016 or 2017 (maybe 25) Leaf or Spark, with no more than 25k miles. 
 
My main concern is battery degradation. What should I expect around 70-100k miles. Will it just lose range and power, etc, or die all together. 
 
I know replacement batteries for the Leaf are around 5k for Leaf, maybe 10k (ouch!) for Spark. Are there signs that these might go down, because if the electric motor is still good, you should be able to keep it going. 
 
Can I get advice on this and opinions or used Leaf vs used Spark? 
Thanks! 
 
Jim",2019,10,11
"Never heard of the Spark - who makes it? And batteries these days are a non-problem, and will normally outlast the car.",2019,10,12
"Spark was a Chevy, actually made by Daewoo. I think it was available as gas as well as full plugin. They can be found used in about the same price range as older Leafs and Fiat 500e.  
 
But.... My understanding is that the shelf life of EV batteries is about 10 years/100,000 miles, and you will start to see degradation as they age. My big fear is buying a car and having to spend five thousand USD or more on new batteries. 
 
My daily commute is only about 22 miles both ways, so that's not a problem.",2019,10,12
"The leaf is ground up EV build. The Chevy has been adapted to be an EV.  
 
The leaf is going to be the better car and there's probably a lot more support for it. 
 
I wouldn't worry about the battery if the mileage is less than 25k.",2019,10,12
"The other bit you didn't state was where you are. Don't know about the Spark, but the fact the Leaf has no battery temperature control makes it less than ideal, in terms of degradation, for very hot areas. Hot batteries age faster.",2019,10,13
"I'm in Missouri, where we unfortunately both extremes: very hot/humid summers, and cold winters.",2019,10,13
